When your glutes go on vacation it forces your hamstrings, quads, etc. to work overtime. 
-
The clamshell is a a great way to teach the precursors of the hinge and to get the glutes firing! üî•

Be sure that the ribs stay down, the back stays flat, and all hip extension occurs from the glutes.
-
As the hips extend, you will feel a stretch across the front of the hip and quads.
-
When you feel like you are at your end range of motion, squeeze the glutes a bit more to achieve full activation.
-
Keeping your glutes strong üí™ creates a stable foundation that supports your entire body.

Do yourself a favor and gives those glutes üçë some attention! :})
