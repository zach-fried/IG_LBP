Always strive for better. I'm passionate about developing, evaluating, and embracing technologies that allow for more effective treatment of spinal conditions. As a field, we should be constantly improving. I shared my thoughts on the future of spine surgery in a recent article from Becker's Spine Review... 

"I hope that we will look back 10 years from now and think that the surgery people were doing in 2020 was archaic. In the future, I think that far fewer fusions will be performed as disc replacement and other motion preserving technologies continue to improve. I am also excited about endoscopic spine surgery, which is becoming an increasingly large part of my practice. It is a true paradigm shift in the field, which allows surgeons to access and address spinal pathology without the morbidity associated with traditional techniques. In many cases, it allows me to perform an ultra-minimally invasive decompression when a fusion might otherwise have been necessary. Patients are comfortably home within hours of surgery and often only take Tylenol for postoperative pain control in the days after the procedure."
