I don’t like to go to the gym at all.

If I start also I give up very easily.

Hardcore cardio, weight lifting is not a cup of mine.

I enjoy doing new activities every day.

I love to do Zumba, Bollywood dance, power yoga, etc.

Whether you do gym or special classes for stretching is everywhere.

It is indispensable or any type of exercise even for walking.

We need to stay fit and stretch will keep our body flexible.

If you want to stay fit and healthy you need to change your habit.

Follow @painoff.official for daily tips on how to get rid of neck, shoulder & and back pain📚

  One of the most common causes of neck pain is simply looking down too often. We know that might sound absurd. You can’t live your entire life without looking down at all, and we’re not asking you to.

  Even though the action of looking down is small, the amount of pressure placed on your neck increases with the frequency of the action. Meaning, looking down to write a check shouldn’t cause you pain, but looking down to work from a laptop eight hours a day, five days a week will.

The pressure from looking down will begin to build in your neck, leading to damage such as neck pain, soreness, upper back muscle spasms, and even premature degeneration which can lead to arthritis.

  Below are several simple ways to reduce the likelihood of experiencing this type of pain.

Prevent Neck Pain From Looking Down

🔹If you believe cell phone usage may be to blame for your pain, try holding your phone higher. Having your phone at eye level eliminates the need to look down at all
🔹f you believe working from a laptop may be a contributing factor, adjust your workspace. You can either place your laptop at eye level and use a separate keyboard, or you can hook your laptop up to a monitor that is at eye level.
🔹If you cannot avoid looking down for long periods of time, take frequent breaks to stretch. To relieve neck pain, gently tilt your head from right to left, holding for about 20 seconds on each side.
🔹Heat therapy may be effective in relieving your pain. Try a heating pad on the affected area for 10-20 minutes, 4-6 times per day.
The measures above may help you in relieving neck pain. If the pain persists, we urge yoyou to reach out to your physician. Chronic pain is a pain in the neck that no one should be content living with.

Only the Pomodoro technique lol. Google Pomodoro Timer and you'll get a super simple timer of 25 minutes. A quick guess is that it takes 25 minutes to cook the pomodoro tomato sauce, but eh, cooking tips is not the topic for this post.
How to release tension/pain in your upper back, neck and shoulder:
1️⃣ Set up a timer to get a reminder every 25 minutes
2️⃣ When the time is up, stand up and move away from your desk
3️⃣ Inhale, lift your arms above your head, just as high as they can go. Keep your spine long. Do not over arch your lower back and look straight ahead.
4️⃣ Exhale, lower your arms down
5️⃣ Inhale, lengthen your spine, as if a string attached to the crown of your head was pulling you up.
6️⃣ Exhale, slowly tuck your chin in and roll your spine down, one vertebra at a time, until your fingers brush the floor. Ben the knees as much as you need to do so.
7️⃣ Inhale, roll back up to standing, keeping the knees bent, until hips, shoulders and head are in one line. 
8️⃣ Repeat the whole process
9️⃣ Set back your timer, and continue your work/activity.

This becomes a yoga technique when you initiate the movement by following your mindful breathing. Remember, Yoga Therapy is is 99% breathing, 1% techniques.

Picture on the Left: Classic sway back posture that myself and so many other moms fall into when carrying their children.  And you might not even realize you are doing it until you catch a glimpse of yourself in a mirror, or reflection in a window, or see yourself in a picture.
.
.
The problem with this posture is we are dumping into our joints, we are just hanging on our joints for support and not engaging our muscular system to help us maintain an upright posture.  Could be weakness, could be lack of awareness, could be both.
.
.
Chronic use of this stance while carrying your child can lead to 
✔️Back pain
✔️Hip pain
✔️SI Joint pain
✔️Pelvic floor dysfunction
✔️Difficulty healing from Diastasis recti
✔️Shallow breathing pattern
.

Instead, try these cues to achieve the more optimal alignment on the right:
✔️Come tall: imagine someone is pulling your pony tail straight up ( try it, pull your pony tail straight up from the crown of your head) you’ll automatically stand up taller
✔️Shift your weight from the balls of your feet towards your heels so that you have equal weight through the front and back of your foot
✔️Practice in the mirror so your body can learn what optimal feels like
✔️You might even think about a slight forward lean
.
.
If you find that you have to carry your child for a prolonged period, be sure to switch up sides, or even try a front carry with the child straddling your waste.  It’s hard to carry them for prolonged periods especially when they start getting wiggly!! And, our bodies aren’t meant to just stand statically in one posture for prolonged periods, so switch it up!#pcesgrad #postpartum #postpartumfitness #alignment #posture #backpain",8,0,False,

اگه ميخوايد از شر اين گره هاى مزاحم 👹خلاص بشيد روش هايي كه توى ويدئو بالا گفتمو امتحان كنيد
.
.
.

توى اولين قدم اين تريگرپوينت ها بايد غيرفعال بشن كه براى اين كار يه توپ تنيسو🎾 داخل يه جوراب بلند 🧦ميذاريم و روى ناحيه دردناك بين خودمون و ديوار قرار ميديم و به آرامى فشار اعمال ميكنيم و روى گره ها حركت ميكنيم 
.
.
.

شما حتى ميتونيد اين حركتو به صورت ثابت و با فشار زياد هم انجام بديد

مدت زمانى كه اين كارو انجام ميديد بسته به شدت فشارى كه مياريد و شدت دردتون بين ١٠تا ٦٠ثانيه در هر دور متغير
.
.
.

براى اينكه اين تريگر پوينتا بهبود پيدا كنن و از بروز مجددشون جلوگيرى بشه بايد عضلاتتونو تقويت كنيد عضلات كمربند شانه اي بيشترين تعداد تريگرپوينتو دارن و اين دوتا تمرينى كه گذاشتم خيلي ميتونه بهتون توى بهبود اين درد كمك كنه 
اين تمريناتو ميتونيد ٢-٤ست ١٢-١٥تكرار  انجام بديد
اما اگه با اين كار رفع نشد يا گره ها جايي بودن كه نتونستيد با توپ غيرفعالش كنيد حتما بايد به يه متخصص ماساژ درمانى مراجعه كنيد دقت كنيد متخصص نه دوستانى كه بدون تحصيلات و مدرك مشت و مال ميدن 🙃

Planks are a perfect exercise for the abdominal muscles because they engage every major core muscle group, including the transverse abdominus, the rectus abdominus, the external oblique muscle, and the glutes. The importance of strengthening each muscle group cannot be underestimated either, for all of these groups serve their own purpose.

Decrease your risk of injury in the back and spinal column:

Doing planks allows you to build muscles while also making sure that you are not putting too much pressure on the spine or hips. Doing planks regularly not only significantly reduces back pain, but also strengthens your muscles and ensures a strong support for your entire back, especially in the areas around your upper back.

Boost your overall metabolism:

Planks are an excellent way of challenging the entire body as doing them every day will burn more calories than most other traditional abdominal exercises, like crunches or sit-ups. The muscles you strengthen by planking on a daily basis will ensure that you burn more energy even if you are spending the majority of your day sitting in the office, or in front of a computer.

Significantly improve your posture:

Doing planks will improve your capacity to stand with straight and stable posture. Strengthening your core you will be able to maintain proper posture at all times because muscles in the abdomen have a profound effect on the overall condition of your neck, shoulders, chest and back.

Improve your overall balance:

Do you have a tough time balancing on one leg? The culprit are the abdominal muscles, which when aren’t strong enough, will fail to give you the balance you need. By doing side planks you’ll improve your balance, while planks with extensions will boost your performance in every kind of sporting activity.

Plank exercises are also thought to affect our nerves by stretching out muscle groups that contribute to stress and tension in the body. planks not only calm your brain, but they can also help with anxiety and symptoms of depression. By @consciousvibrancy",317,9,False,

Turmeric grows as a root or plant, similar to ginger. Curcumin is the chemical or active ingredient in turmeric that gives it the distinctive yellow (spice) or orange (root) color. Curcumin is widely recognized to have strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potential.

👉At SierraSil, we chose the MerivaⓇ curcumin due to its high bio-availability of bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC), and it’s been shown to be highly complementary to our minerals. Clinical research has shown that it reduces the symptoms of delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) among other benefits, and we like that our quality testing ensures that it’s free of artificial curcumin and pesticides.

Core strength is something we should all work on - not just athletes but anyone who would like to keep being healthy and spare their hips/knees/lower back from chronic injuries down the road. Core activation/strength exercises can look like so many different things as long as you understand what to focus on. 
⁣
There’s still the misconception that for you to have a strong core you need to do an insane amount of crunches which most times it ends up being the reason for lower back pain. Crunches is an exercise that if not done properly, can lead to a variety of compensation patterns. If your core is not strong enough to bring you up, your neck will do so. If your neck can do it - you’ll extend your lower back to use momentum to bring you back up. 
⁣
Here are different course sizes that you can do that are safe and challenging as well.

I’m not an optometrist so I don’t know what the issue is. 

I was just able to recognize what was abnormal about this gentleman’s PRI testing and his inability to feel certain muscles. It had nothing to do with biomechanics from the traditional point of view. 

Although I wouldn’t wish my personal “sensory processing/pain ” history on anyone, the experience does help me identify what could be going on with others, simply because I know what it’s like to “feel” or “not feel” depending on how you vary sensory input. 

When the input is good, muscles are felt relatively easily. When the input is “off” it can be a real struggle and may never happen at all (especially left hamstring and anterior glute medius) until the input is corrected via inter-disciplinary treatment (vision and/or dental/oral). 

Luckily most people have no need for that, they just have crappy sensory input from the ground and from inside their own body. 

PRI techniques with a big emphasis on turning them into “sensory experiences” is all most people need to resolve their idiopathic pain .",20,2,False,

This is a surgical procedure in which two or more vertebrae are permanently joined into one solid bone. It's designed to stop the motion at a painful vertebral segment, which in turn, should decrease pain generated from the joint.⠀
⠀
There are many approaches to lumbar spinal fusion surgery, and all involve the following process:⠀
⠀
🔆Adding bone graft to a segment of the spine⠀
🔅Set up a biological response that causes the bone graft to grow between the two vertebral elements to create a bone fusion⠀
🔆The boney fusion results in one fixed bone replacing a mobile joint and stops the motion at that joint-segment⠀

🔺Bend your hips and knees to squat down to your load, keep it close to your body, and straighten your legs to lift. Never lift a heavy object above shoulder level. Avoid turning or twisting your body while lifting or holding a heavy object.

🔴 Why is it important?

🔺It is very important to lift heavy objects in a safe manner otherwise you could be putting your back, shoulders, knees and other joints at risk of injury. 
🔺Using safe postures and techniques while lifting will minimize the stress and load through your spine and other joints.

🔺 One of the most common causes of lower back injury is incorrect lifting technique. 

🔺When you lift an object with bad posture, the muscles in your back become inhibited and do not work correctly. 

🔺This causes a greater load to be placed through the bones, ligaments and discs in your spine which may lead to severe back pain or injury. 🔴  #rehab #rehabilitation #physiotherapy #physicaltherapy #lifting #liftingweights #weight #propermethods #propertecniqueoverweight #backpain #spinalinjury #lowerbackpain #healthylifestyle #health #spinehealth #physiotherapist #healthonline1",6,0,False,

• Ex Professional Dancer",2020-08-10 17:55:56,"Have you been struggling with chronic pain on and off for years? You’ve tried conventional medicine but it hasn’t worked. In fact you didn’t really find out medical reasons around the pain. Every time you have a flare up, you start dreading....here we go again’.😣 Maybe you’ve gradually built up frustration over the years about your ‘condition’.😤

I fully understand you because I’ve been there, and I know it can be really challenging to navigate through especially if it starts to bother you from your daily movements. Often you just want the pain to go away ASAP so you can go back to feeling ‘normal’ again.

Whilst that’s completely understandable, have you ever taken time to inquire deeper about the pain you’re experiencing? What would it be like if you could begin to really understand what’s going on with your body?

Even if it may be uncomfortable find some quiet time and begin to connect with your body.

💚Focus your awareness to the area of the pain you’re experiencing. 

💚You may want to place your hand on the pain area and ask your body something like; ‘Hello body...I never talked to you before and I’m sorry if I’ve neglected you in some ways. I want to understand you better so we can begin to heal together. What do you want me to know?’ 

💚Notice any feelings, thoughts or memories that arises. At first you may not get any answers, and that’s ok. Don’t give up just yet! 

💚The more often you connect with your body and ask, the more you will begin to receive hints and clues. 

💚Remember that our body is very intelligent and it already knows how to heal. 

May you begin the journey to heal your body from inside out. Realize that you have the power to heal your body when you believe you can. 🙏🏼

🤘🏼A step by step squat demonstration🤘🏼
*
I have athletes come to me saying they have lower back pain. 
*
If you're a regular weight lifter, I would predict that lower back pain is down to technique on movements like squats and deadlifts which needs improving. 
*
The key is to not let your chest drop down during the squat, otherwise the weight of the bar shifts from the stability of your legs, hips and core to being almost all on the lumbar spine. This can cause disc issues, muscle strains and sciatica symptoms. 
*
This is how I would squat, based on knowledge I've gained from from my experience working with soft tissue and body mechanics, working with a PT (shout out to @kamil.pt_  for helping me to lift effectively and safely) and from years of making similar mistakes and injuring myself!
*
If you need relief from lower back tension, come see me. We can look at your compound movements and see what you may need to work on 😁😁 Link to booking system in bio 📞📩

Our bodies are designed to adapt and complete movements regardless if they are functional or not.

Most people can pick up on the big details, but the small details are often overlooked.
-
In order to ensure your leg 🦵bones are in proper position, you need to pay attention to your 🦶.
-
Make sure all the toes are pushing through the floor on both feet. Think about keeping the heels stacked up over the foot.

Performance 🔑 Points:
1. Create a straight line from ear 👂 to  knee.
2. Keep the butt cheeks rock hard 🤘
3. Keep the heels over the center of the feet. Push those toes through the floor!
4. Keep the rib cage down and get deep breaths down to the bottom of the lungs.

Enjoying the artistic dance of acupuncture + Chinese herbal medicine, + a whole lot of cupping therapy in Walla Walla, WA.",2020-08-10 17:25:36,"Spine health. In 2012, one of my dear supervisors, Fang Zhang of Portland, OR, during my master's program in acupuncture and East Asian medicine taught me the Winding Dragon treatment for spinal health and anxiety support. I've used it so many times since with excellent results. The treatment starts with Bladder 10 at the base of the skull, and alternates needles between the facet joints of the vertebra from C7 to L1 finishing with anchoring points of Bladder 23 to support the kidneys, the seat of our vitality. The practitioner then pets the needles. Most patients say they can now imagine what it feels like to be a cat being petted. ⁠
⁠
This treatment stimulates where the nerves leave the spinal cord to interact with the rest of the body, it gently stimulates the majority of the spine for spinal health, and the act of petting the needles helps to quickly transition someone from the fight or flight nervous system (sympathetic) to the rest and relax nervous system (parasympathetic). I often use it when someone has high stress, high anxiety or a really horrible day, and also has back pain or chronic back conditions. ⁠
⁠
I've had patients request this for calming their nerves while trying to quit smoking, for general mental calm, and, of course, for back pain. ⁠

 The  injury that occurred in June 2013 when as I was getting out of bed- one of my dogs shot her head out from underneath, so I simply moved my leg to get out of her way. No major event… or so I thought.  I showered, rode the train to work (standing the whole time) and then started my day.  After a 30 minute meeting someone asked me to speak with them and I couldn’t get out of my chair... my back stopped communicating with the rest of my body.  My colleague immediately asked what was wrong as I had a look of “sheer terror” 😱 on my face.  This led to several WEEKS laying in bed.
•
•
•
Despite excellent therapy and doctors my back was changed.  This was impossible to accept as working out and being able to do anything had become as routine to me as brushing my teeth.  I tried to adjust my life but even when not exercising my body was different. Notably, my ease and range of mobility decreased, if I wasn’t in pain I was uncomfortable at best, running more than a short distance was close to impossible and about 15-20 times per year I was completely sidelined and had to just lay on my back all day.  This was very upsetting because I realized I actually started to just get used to being in pain and discomfort as my new normal.

Needless to say, the transition from empowered high heels echoing down a hallway, or a demanding daily schedule that requires coffee in hand, to watching birds from your balcony - can really expose your insecurities, make you feel heart-wrenchingly vulnerable and bring up all sorts of resistance. 

But in time, through an open heart and much conscious breath, you can awaken to see that really, it's all. just. life. fast or slow, good or bad. here or there. 

And actually, the more accelerated we are, the less we get to experience it, learn from it, and fully appreciate it. 

So whether you have voluntarily slowed down, or you face a circumstance that has required you to do so, give yourself an opportunity to truly see the good that's happening. The good that exists in you and all around you.

I saw it myself in my family, friends and students over the last 10 years:
Spine surgeries after a herniated disc that made it worse and people now living with constant pain.
Knee surgeries that held for a few years then something else went or Arthrosis setting in.
Giving Botox and Anti-Epileptic Medication after Whiplash for they know nothing else?
⠀
What if we could change that and train and eat our way out of pain? And heal the heck out of it?
⠀
For the first time ever I compiled all I learned (and still do) in a 12 week  group coaching program (provided  live online Zoom).
Start will be September 5th/6th.
⠀
This is a small group and limited to 8 people at max and will run only once this year.
I also got 3 spots to do this training 1:1.
⠀
PM for details and saving your seat.
⠀
Stay tuned.

We treat common medical problems + auto accident injuries in Charleston, N. Charleston, and Summerville",2020-08-10 17:09:12,"How Long Does Chiropractic Treatment Take? (Part 3):
•
If you live an active lifestyle that consists of regular exercise, you will most likely respond to chiropractic care faster than someone who doesn’t exercise and lives a sedentary lifestyle. Exercise helps the body heal, and regular movement helps make sure that your joints don’t get stuck in one position. That’s why I always advise my patients to start some type of exercise once they’ve begun treatment. I’m not asking them to go out and run a marathon twice a week, just go out for a thirty minute walk three times a week. You would be surprised how much better you would feel after a few weeks.
•
Finally, the length of your treatment plan depends on whether you want to just get out of pain, or if you want to actually fix the problem that caused you pain in the first place. If you are just concerned with getting out of pain, your treatment time will be much shorter, however there is a good chance the pain will come back if the underlying problem is not fixed. That’s why chiropractors usually recommend care even once the patient is out of pain. This ensures that the bones stay in the proper position and the joints stay moving properly, thus fixing the problem so that you don’t have to worry about it coming back again.

👉🏽How to stay young and flexible 

Keeping your body young and flexible is important for everyone working seated like in front of a computer but especially for us #dentist #surgeon who work in a super unnatural, kind of crippling position on a daily basis. 

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐏𝐑𝐎𝐁𝐋𝐄𝐌
is that your body adapts to this position and molds the muscles and connective tissues over time and you don’t even recognize this. 

🧐I have seen a lot of my colleagues becoming “𝐇𝐔𝐍𝐂𝐇𝐁𝐀𝐂𝐊𝐒” and experienced back&neck pain or numb fingers early in my career which got me thinking of a more overall posture optimized work routine.

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐒𝐎𝐋𝐔𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍:
Together with my wolves 🐺 of Berlin @bardi12 and @malteprime from @mtmgym we developed an easy to apply 𝐐𝐔𝐈𝐂𝐊 𝐌𝐎𝐁𝐈𝐋𝐈𝐓𝐘 𝐑𝐎𝐔𝐓𝐈𝐍𝐄 which will keep you young and flexible with only investing 5minutes every day (more might actually be better but it’s a good start). 

Easy applicable you can also do these quick stretches in between your surgeries or any other breaks from work. 

Again:
CONSISTENCY IS KEY 🔑 

Just add this to your morning routine and, or right before bed.

Your neck, shoulders and hips will thank you for taking care. It’s worth it!!

Let’s give it a try. Enjoy

Cheers,
Dr. Dome

Sharing is caring ! 

My sister was diagnosed with 3rd stage #BreastCancer in 2018. But she opted for natural remedies and treatment. After more than a year on this treatment, her condition became worse. She #LostWeight & appetite, was very weak and cannot walk. 

We suggested her for chemotherapy, then she agreed.
She needs to do 6 Chemos. The first few chemos have to be separated into 3 sessions due to weak body condition, low levels of haemoglobin. 
 
My friend - Esther, introduced me to Shiruto. My sister started to consume 6 sachets per day. 

With #Shiruto she can finished each chemo in just 1 session, moreover she doesn’t feel discomfort or any vomiting. Haemoglobin lévela also increase to Normal.

After taking the second set of 8+1, her condition improved even more tremendously. She has more strength and appetite and can even walk. She puts on weight and blood test was good all the time.

Surprisingly the #CancerLump on the breast came off just like that (Photo shown here). 😱😱😱
She doesn’t have #BackPain anymore after this happened 👍

Even doctors were surprised. They kept asking what she has consumed. All test results showed that she was good and she doesn’t need to do the last chemo!!! 😱😱😱

We feel so blessed and happy about this. It’s like a miracle has happened to us!! I want to say a big thank you to my friend Esther and to BEinternational for having such a marvellous product !!

If you recognize the word yoga, you also probably recognize the move referred to as downward dog.⁣
⁣
It’s a great position that can help to:⁣
-reduce stress and bring a sense of calmness⁣
-energize the body⁣
-stretch the shoulders, hamstrings, calves, arches, back and hands⁣
-relieve menstrual discomfort (when done with the head supported)⁣
-relieve headaches, back pain, and fatigue⁣
⁣
If your feeling tired as a dog, maybe you need some of this for a Monday restart ;)⁣
⁣
The How To:⁣
⁣
1.  On all fours, spread the palms wide, and stack the shoulders over wrists.  Position knees hip distance apart, and curl the toes under.  Walk the palms just out in front of the shoulders. Be sure the palms are spread flat, no air under palms.⁣
⁣
2. Push down into the palms, raise the knees off the mat while shifting the stomach toward the thighs.  Lift the hips up high, as the legs straighten. Keep toes pointing forward.Begin by maintaining a slight bend in the knees and over time as the body becomes more flexible slowly straightening the legs, reaching heels toward the mat. Don’t lock the legs; keep a soft bend in your knees.⁣
⁣
3. Hold the position for 5-10 or more breaths, release onto the knees to come out of the posture. Repeat 2-3 times during the day stretch and elongate the entire body.⁣
⁣
Give it a try (bonus points for partnering with a furry friend), listen to your body,  and let us know how this move improved your Monday!⁣

They are definitely my favorite medicine.

Yesterday was the first day I actually noticed some of my pre-surgery pain  was gone! 😭🙏🏼 When I got up in the morning and pushed myself upright on my bed, I felt no pain in my lower back. It was incredible. Pre-surgery, getting in and out of bed was super painful. I had sharp searing pain in my lower back and hips every time I would make any movement. So to feel no pain for the first time (other than the incision pain), was such an incredible experience for me. I also sat down at the table with my husband for lunch and felt no pain in my lower back/hips. I started crying. I could not believe it.

Living in chronic pain for so long almost makes you disassociate. You don’t even realize how much pain you are living with on a daily basis until it’s gone. So a little thing like sitting at the table to eat and suddenly it hits you that the old pain is gone, is such an emotional experience.

I do still have other symptoms that have not gotten better yet:

-new numbness in my right thigh since I woke up from surgery. Both thighs were actually numb, but the left thigh has gotten better and right thigh still feels about 50% better
-old numbness in top of left foot/shin (I’ve had this for years so I know it will take time for my nerves to wake up)
-shooting pain in my left leg from my buttock to ankle 

My doctor said these things should clear up within the next few weeks as my nerves are waking up after being compressed for so long, and also because he had to move the nerves out of the way to perform the surgery, so they may still be irritated from that.

Selective Transforaminal Nerve Root Block: a safe and effective treatment option for debilitating neck & back pain
* When a nerve root in the spine is injured or irritated it can produce unbearable neck or back pain that may radiate to your arms or legs.
* Selective Transforaminal Nerve Root Blocks under Fluoroscopy Guided-Image Technology is a quick, safe, effective alternative solution for treating pain associated with a pinched nerve.
* A Selective Transforaminal Nerve Root Block involves directly injecting a mixture of anesthetic and anti-inflammatory medication into the epidural space of the affected nerve.
* By appropriately treating your neck or back pain, you can quickly recover to your optimal physical and functional abilities, thus improving your quality of life.
Spinal pathology is a serious public health issue affecting over 200 million people each year. Spinal pain, particularly in the lumbosacral region and the cervical region, is one of the most common types of pain and can be the most debilitating and impact an individual’s quality of life. In fact, most spine problems are due to a pinched nerve root. A pinched nerve is a nerve under pressure. This pressure often comes from surrounding bone or soft tissues. All throughout the spine, there are several openings, called foramina, through which the nerve roots emerge. When a foramen is partially closed from an osteophyte, bulging disc, osteoarthritis, facet joint disease, or misalignment of the vertebrae, etc., the nerve root may be compressed. A pinched nerve will lose its ability to carry accurate signals, and its wayward signals can cause a variety of sensations in the body.

In Davenport, Iowa on September 18, 1895, D.D. Palmer, a magnetic healer, encountered a deaf man by the name of Harvey Lillard that worked as a janitor in his office building. Mr. Lillard had been deaf for 17 years since he heard a ""pop"" in his back. D.D. Palmer discovered one of Mr. Lillard's vertebra was misaligned and when the correct alignment was achieved by way of spinal adjustment, Mr. Lillard's hearing was restored. Thus, the study of Chiropractic was born. .

⁣
This breaks down movement to determine whether someone’s dysfunctional movement is one of mobility or of motor control (muscle activation).⁣
⁣
Example: toe touch is NOT always dysfunctional because tight hamstrings ⁣
⁣
Our body is comprised of major joint segments that alternate from stable/mobile. ⁣
⁣
Example: ⁣
foot stable⁣
ankle mobile⁣
knee stable⁣
hip mobile ... all the way ⬆️ ⁣
⁣
Any dysfunction to these areas will lead to compensation and possibly pain. (To be expected, no one will have exact symmetry left to right) ⁣
⁣
These movement assessments and tests will help determine where to work on the body, and whether someone needs to activate certain areas or if mobility work needs to be incorporated. ⁣

⁣
I've been throwing in a lot of dead hangs off the pull up rig & mixing them up with different variations. On top of that I've been doing a lot more carrys, farmers, overhead, bear hugs etc.⁣
⁣
Why? ⁣
⁣
For better shoulder flexibility, better grip and arm strength! ⁣
⁣
Many people want better pull ups, toes to bar & a stronger grip for pulling strength, but struggle to hold a set of DBs for 100m nor can they hang comfortably for :30+. ⁣
⁣
Since working on this my grip strength has increased, shoulders more flexible and pull ups/TTb become less taxing! ⁣
⁣
In this video I hit 7 rounds; ⁣

⠀
This medicinal plant is a great addition to any home. It produces oxygen at night, so like the other plants listed, it will improve the air in your bedroom. This plant is known as a ‘succulent’ – it needs very little watering as it maintains moisture within its leaves. The gel from these leaves can be used to treat minor cuts and burns, insect bites and dry skin. It is, therefore, a great plant to have around the house! Keep your Aloe Vera plant in a sunny place to ensure it stays healthy.⠀

⁣Stretching has got a bad rep over recent times. With the explosion of mobility (I know I talk about mobility ALOT!)

The thing is... flexibility is a prerequisite for accessing greater range of motion, and therefore improving you mobility. You can't have one without the other.

For me and I’m sure for other's, stretching has many more benefits than just lengthening the the muscle and our bodies. These are a few personal favourites : ⁣

RDT is a powerful technique using essential oils that was developed by D Gary Young (Young Living founder) in the 1980s. It combines several modalities to bring balance and transformation.

This technique involves applying therapeutic grade essential oils to the spine, neck and feet. A session will last about an hour but the benefits may last about a week or more!

Most importantly RDT is non invasive and suitable for all ages. You can also do it at home for your loved ones - love and care make a huge different when it comes to therapy.

When you are standing, shift your butt back so your hips are directly over your heel.

This allows your bones to be in better alignment and allows you to use all your muscles more evenly.

If your hips are too far forward (swipe right) you are out of alignment, you put a lot of stress on your joints and you are not using muscles proportionately. All of this can lead to pain in your lower back, hips, knees and ankles!

So shift that booty back and start paying attention to your standing posture.

📺 YT:  Truth About Training
🎯: Use current research to improve your training",2020-08-10 16:10:39,"💪This week we are taking a closer look at the Quadratus Lumborum! 💪

➖

Originating from the Latin words ""quadrus"" meaning ‘square’ & ""lumbus"" for ‘loin’.

➖

Fun fact: It is it’s own primary antagonist, meaning as one contracts, the other resists that movement.

➖

Upon first inspection, this looks to be a deep muscle of the lower back, but surprisingly it is actually the deepest muscle of the abdomen, located posteriorly on the thorax.

➖

While the medial portion is buried underneath the thoracolumbar aponeurosis (fascia that covers deep muscles of the back) & the thick erector spinae.

The lateral aspect can be palpated from the side of the torso.

➖

Overuse and strain of the quadratus lumborum are one of the major causes for chronic pain in the lower back.

This comes from sitting at the desk in a reclined seat, which releases the intrinsic back muscles, weakening them in the long term. 

To compensate, the quadratus lumborum takes the strain which leads to painful tension and stiffening of the muscle.

➖

ACTION:
•	Elevate the pelvis
•	Laterally flex spine to same side
•	Assist in extension of spine
•	Fix last rib during forced inhalation + exhalation

ORIGIN:
•	Posterior Iliac Crest

INSERTION:
•	12th rib + Transverse Processes L1-L4

NERVE:
•	Lumbar Plexus (T12, L1, L2, L3)

Strengthening Exercises:
•	Side glute bridge
•	Squat

⠀
#Wow, right? ⠀
⠀
Of course, once neck pain sets on we can help manage pain and, if caught early enough, to prevent future chronic damage/pain. ⠀
⠀
But if we work in an office, is there a way we can reduce our risk before the pain onsets? ⠀
⠀
Yes! And in some cases, by up to 68%! ⠀
⠀
Some suggestions that have been made by studies include: ⠀
👉 Taking daily walks ⠀
👉 Stretching and endurance training ⠀
👉 Stress management training ⠀
👉 Other combinations of exercises and stretches ⠀

It does this by releasing pressure on bones and joints, as well as the spine. Increased brain development promotes better concentration. It can improve focus and reduce hyperactivity.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

The nervous system, which consists of your brain, spinal cord and nerves, controls everything in the body, including growth and development. Subluxations, also known as misalignments, in the spine can prevent proper communication from the brain to the body.

Improving the quality of your health from the earliest beginnings and throughout your life!",2020-08-10 16:01:12,"💥 Text Neck ALERT! 💥
These four pictures are a pretty realistic snippet of what we see all around us.  Phone use is ever on the rise, especially with the constant updates flooding in about everything the world is going through right now.

Did you know that weight of force on your neck is calculated based on the angle in which your head is bent down? 

With your head bent at a...
 0° angle the weight of force on your neck is between 10-12lbs.
 15° angle the weight of force on your neck is about 27lbs.
30° angle the weight of force on your neck is about 40lbs.
45° angle the weight of force on your neck is about 49lbs.
60° angle the weight of force on your neck is about 60lbs.

That's a lot of weight on your neck!  We know that our phones are our lifelines and also our main source of information, so eliminating them isn't a practical solution.  However, cultivating healthy habits and body awareness can immensely reduce unnecessary phone time with poor posture.

DISTANCE IS NOT A BARRIER!!
Because God is Spirit, He can be in all places at all times by His Spirit 
_

What started as a back pain soon aggravated to a crippling ailment that caused Nasrin Fallar to be bedridden.

An Iranian living in Australia, she had to seek the services of a carer who did virtually everything for her. 

However, God’s healing power, not limited by space and time, located her right in her home and flushed out every atom of sickness in her system as Prophetess Anne prayed for her. 

Rising to her feet, she removed the neck collar and lumbar corset and testified that all the pain she had was gone as she began to walk unaided!

RDT is a powerful technique using essential oils that was developed by D Gary Young (Young Living founder) in the 1980s. It combines several modalities to bring balance and transformation.

This technique involves applying therapeutic grade essential oils to the spine, neck and feet. A session will last about an hour but the benefits may last about a week or more!

Most importantly RDT is non invasive and suitable for all ages. You can also do it at home for your loved ones - love and care make a huge different when it comes to therapy.

𝟭- 𝗜𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗯𝗹𝘆 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗹𝗼𝘄 𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸.
Low back pain rarely actually stems from the low back. We call this blaming the victim instead of the criminal. Oftentimes, pain in this region stems from lack of mobility or strength in the joint or group of joints above or below the region, such as the thoracic spine (mid-back) or hips. Consistently cracking the low back and ignoring other joints can lead to further pain down the road.

𝟮- 𝗜𝗺𝗮𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗺𝗮𝘆 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗯𝗲 𝗮 𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗳𝗶𝗴𝘂𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗼𝗼𝘁 𝗰𝗮𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗽𝗮𝗶𝗻.
While an MRI may suggest disc disorders in the lumbar spine, this is often not the actual cause of pain. Once serious problems are ruled out by a physician, minor findings (such as minimal disc degenerations) are of no value in helping to explain the vast majority of aches and pain. Degenerative changes are present in 40% of people under the age of 30, and 90% of individuals over 55, most of whom do not have any symptoms. For this reason, studies show that imaging may even be more harmful to chronic pain from a psychological perspective.

𝟯- 𝗠𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗚𝗢𝗢𝗗!
Your instinct might be to lay around and stop moving, but daily pain-free physical activity can actually decrease low back pain, as it can improve mobility and strength in the legs which will reduce stress on the low back. If there are specific movements that elicit pain, be sure to tell a movement specialist who can analyze the biomechanics of such activities to find pain-free ways for you to do them. 

𝟰- 𝗤𝘂𝗶𝗰𝗸 𝗳𝗶𝘅𝗲𝘀 𝘄𝗼𝗻’𝘁 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝗹𝗼𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺.
Imagine having a leak in your house. A quick fix like throwing some tape over it will help for a bit, but that will require you to waste a ton of time and tape over the years. Instead, fixing the root cause of the leak will lead to lasting results and less water damage.

People who feel restricted in their movement can feel like they are constantly stiff or in pain. Getting stuck in certain movement patterns can be hard to get out of. Creating new movement patterns though are just like learning musical notes, the more you know, the better the song will sound. But how do we develop new patterns? Researchers now believe that to install a new pattern, it’s just takes 60 times, 21 days in a row. That’s very achievable. So for example, if you have a sore back, you may have lost the movement patterns for pelvic tilting, hip hinge, or squatting. If you practice these movements everyday, you will start to get these patterns back so they are stored sub-consciously and ready to use when you need them throughout the day. So don’t get stuck, start small and let your body break free.

""Work hard in silence... Let your success be your Noise.""",2020-08-10 15:51:45,"Herniated disc, bulging disc, or slipped disc? However you  describe it, this condition can be extremely painful. (And can even be quite debilitating!)
Just try picking up your baby or child with a herniated disc.

🌟 Herniated discs are most common in early to middle-aged adults. They’re often caused when too much pressure is put on an otherwise healthy spine.

🌟 The spine is composed of many bony vertebrae, separated by jelly-like discs.

These discs:

* cushion the joints during impact

* allow for movement in the spine

* keep the vertebrae in place

🌟 A herniated disc occurs when the soft inside of the disc (the nucleus) leaks through the tough outer portion (the annulus). This irritates the surrounding nerves, causing inflammation and pain.

🌟 A herniated disc often occurs with movements, including:

* lifting

* pulling

* bending

* twisting

Bad posture and poor ergonomics may also contribute to its likelihood.

When the herniated disc affects the nerves in a specific area of the spine, it can lead to pain and weakness in the area of the body that specific nerve serves.

Here are some safe stretches and exercises that you can do if you find yourself with a herniated discs, a slipped disc or just overall lower back pain (which we have probably all encountered at some point and time) 
 (I also really  like the cat and cow pose/stretch, which is not pictured here) 🐈 🐄 #yoga

Happy stretching and moving that magnificent body and Happy Healing, y'all. 🤠 💞💜🥰❣️💓

🙏🏼 Discover new accounts",2020-08-10 15:49:59,"Low Trap Progression💥
-
💥 The middle and lower trapezius muscles (as well as the neck and upper back extensors) can be helpful to strengthen in order to improve or maintain shoulder joint health as well as reducing postural strain (sitting in the same position all day) on the upper back if they are underutilized on a day-to-day basis
-
📌 Without going into too much detail, the mid and lower traps help to retract, depress, upwardly rotate, posteriorly tilt, and externally rotate the scapulae (shoulder blades) during shoulder movements and activities
-
📌 Improving the strength and control of these movements can help to assist your smaller rotator cuff muscles to work more efficiently (decreased chance of strain) and avoid any unwanted movement or pinching of the shoulder joint structures (especially during overhead movements)
-
🎥 Today's progression off a bench (or bed) not only works these muscles but also strengthens the muscles that extend (pull back) the head and upper back, which often work together for improved shoulder function
-
❌ For an example on why this is important, try slouching and jutting your head forward while raising your arms overhead...it doesn't work very well!
-
🎥 Here are 6 LEVELS that progress from easier to harder:
-
1️⃣ Hands at side - Palms Down
2️⃣ Hands at side - Palms Down - with Lift
3️⃣ Hands Behind Head
4️⃣ Hands Behind Head - Lift Hands off Head
5️⃣ Shoulders and Elbows at 90 degrees
6️⃣ Y Raise
-
💯 To increase resistance, hold light dumbbells or plates off the edge of a bench or other elevated surface. You likely won't be using anything more than 5 to 10 lb if you focus on correct form and quality of movement
-
🗝 Coaching Keys:
📌 If your lower back starts hurting with these, focus on keeping your stomach tight and squeeze your butt cheeks to thrust and hold your ""belt buckle"" on the ground...if this doesn't work, put 1-3 pillows under your stomach (to reduce the arch of your back)
📌 Start each movement by tucking the chin (make a double chin) and pull the back of your head to the ceiling and hold it there
📌 Roll your shoulders back and together and don't let them shrug up toward your ears

.
I was a 17 year old volleyball and basketball player when I experienced my first bout of severe back pain. It happened the same year as a severe high ankle sprain.
.
It was excruciatingly painful to get out of bed or take a step for several weeks.
.
That would happen 3 more times before the age of 25, each time worse than the other including having my big toe intermittently go numb.
.
The thing is...I was ACTIVE. I worked out since I was 14, played sports since I could walk, had a 32” vertical at the time, ran 3-5 miles 3-5x/week and frequently moved around in my free time.
.
Something was missing though. When I figured it out, my life and movement was transformed...
.
Tomorrow I’ll share what that missing link was and how I think everyone can have the same transformation 🙌 💪.

Most of the population love to lie on their belly which further may affect the curvature of our spine. We all here love to sleep but who knows, it may aggravate your pain when you awake and gives you discomfort all day along.
===========================

So one should switch their position frequently to avoid any further more complications which gives extra pressure on the neck, hips, lower back regions certainly it increases your lower back pain.
===========================

If you sleep on your back, try placing a pillow under your knees while you snooze. This will allow for proper alignment of the spine. If you sleep on your stomach, a pillow under your lower abdomen can help, while those who sleep on their side should tuck the pillow between their knees.

DISTANCE IS NOT A BARRIER!!
Because God is Spirit, He can be in all places at all times by His Spirit 
_

What started as a back pain soon aggravated to a crippling ailment that caused Nasrin Fallar to be bedridden.

An Iranian living in Australia, she had to seek the services of a carer who did virtually everything for her. 

However, God’s healing power, not limited by space and time, located her right in her home and flushed out every atom of sickness in her system as Prophetess Anne prayed for her. 

Rising to her feet, she removed the neck collar and lumbar corset and testified that all the pain she had was gone as she began to walk unaided!

Helping you to thrive, not just survive.",2020-08-10 15:41:03,"This is, in my opinion, the order you should seek healthcare help. If you can listen to your body when it's whispering to you, letting you know it isn't work at the optimal level, then you can avoid having it scream at you.

⚠Obviously there are exceptions to every rule,⚠ but as a rough guideline you can't go wrong.

Chiropractic is drug-free and the only side-effects are feeling better in your body, less pain and better neural function. What's not to love?

Even common, over the counter drugs like ibuprofen and paracetamol have huge side-effects. Stomach ulcers, nausea, constipation, heartburn, fever and jaundice to name a just a few.

And it's shocking to me how often surgery will be offered to patients as the first port of call, rather than a last resort 😱

Chiro isn't (always!) a quick fix, but it's a better option than the knife.

⠀
Do you feel like you carry all your stress and tension in your neck and shoulders? ⠀
⠀
Neck pain is a very common, but often very painful condition. A simple test to determine if you suffer from neck pain that may lead to even further health conditions is to test your range of motion. Look down at your chest, presently gaze toward the roof, at last turn your head to one side and left. On the off chance that you said “ouch” while you where playing out these straightforward assignments, This Is Not Normal! Neck torment can be straightforwardly connected to subluxations (spinal misalignment). Chiropractic doctors are prepared widely in the determination and care of neck torment conditions.⠀

Dry needling certified. 💪🏼",2020-08-10 15:33:04,"Dysfunction in your body leads to aches, pains, numbness, tingling, headaches, tmjd, etc. You may have one of these symptoms or a combination of a few. Sometimes there’s something that has happened in your life that you know for certain caused this dysfunction (for example, a car accident or a fall) while other times it was a gradual process and you can’t recall a particular event (for example, chronic stress)
⠀⠀⠀
There are 3 T’s that can contribute to dysfunction in your body and the musculoskeletal system (bones, joints, muscles)
⠀⠀⠀
1- trauma. This one is pretty obvious most of the time but sometimes it can be tricky. For example, someone that does a repetitive micro trauma. Something that doesn’t seem like much in the beginning, but over time it causes issues in your systems. Calling everyone that sits for hours on a computer in the same position for work everyday!!!
⠀⠀⠀
2- thoughts. What I’m really talking about is stress, but needed a T so it would be easy to remember. Like I’ve said before, stress in small amounts is normal. When we remain in a stressed out state for extended periods then it causes our body to show symptoms which may include, headaches, muscle spasm, joints not moving like they are supposed to, etc.
⠀⠀⠀
3- toxins. Our body has to process anything that enters. Foods, water, air, etc. We can’t live on junk food and cokes everyday and expect our body to function it’s best! Just like a plant needs sunlight, food, water... we do too! 80/20 rule is my go too.
⠀⠀⠀
My job is to help you feel and function better. To create a treatment plan that fits your individual needs and to give you tools to use to combat the 3 T’s of daily life!

⛲ Pretty sure you all know how important staying hydrated is for the skin, joints, brain, body temperature and the list goes on 

👀 Life nowadays (ESPECIALLY post lockdown) has turned all of us into screen sluts, shuffling between our TVs, mobiles and laptops so it's even more essential to follow the 20-20-20 rule ie, look at something that is 20 metres away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes

Good for you I'm gonna tell you how to get rid of it in just 12 mins

Contrast baths are your best friend when it comes to joint pain

This technique is widely used in the physio world, and for a reason

It yields great results

The idea is simple, heat and cold therapy have their own benefits

So you combine them to get the best of both worlds 

The cold temperature makes it harder for the nerves to send the pain signals 

The heat increased blood flow to the area to heal better and increases range of motion

You put your wrist for example in hot water, enough to get the blood flowing, you leave it for 3 mins

Then you alternate to ice or an ice pack for a minute

Repeat this cycle 3 times

You'll feel much more confident in your joint and notice how the pain is gone

All ages & fitness levels | Pro & Olympic athletes",2020-08-10 15:17:50,"What does back pain have to do with tight hips? ⬇️ Read below

Sitting for hours on end pulls on the lower spine, leading to a shortening of the hip flexor muscles -- an important group that attaches the lower leg to the hip and the thighbone to the spine. Tightness in these muscles can lead to pain downward (into the knees) or upward (causing back pain) - which then leads to imbalance further along the muscle chains. Stretching and rebalancing the full leg, hip, and spine through dynamic stretches for the hips, help to relieve back, hip, and knee pain while simultaneously improving your posture. 

 ⬆️ This is one of our go-to stretches to target tight hip flexors and release the lower back. The trick is to focus on tucking the bum under as the knee goes down, rather than doing a straight lunge.",99,2,False,

🙌 Free Yourself from the Burden of Low Back Pain 💗",2020-08-10 15:15:29,"💚I felt the constriction in my chest and the tears well up.  My emotions were so intense they felt like they were going to explode out of my chest.  And yet I stayed with it.  I was deep into meditation and experience has taught me that sticking with this feeling would result in a huge load being lifted, and would leave me feeling more open, freer & like a wound had healed.⁠
⁠
💙The only way I am able to have the healing occur is to dive deep into the suck.  The intense, awful emotions that often have me sobbing.  And being able to pull through this experience is hard.  It is still hard.  But knowing what is on the other side makes it tolerable - and honestly, very welcome. ⁠
⁠
💛Mindfulness is an incredibly important tool for someone who wants to free themselves from the burden of pain.  But learning it at first?  It not only is HARD, but also just feels shitty.  It uncovers ugly truths of our lives.  Forces us to finally face the beliefs & thoughts in our heads that we have kept quiet by staying busy & distracting ourselves. ⁠
⁠
🧡When facing this discomfort and initial “worsening” it can be tempting to abandon mindfulness as an important part of the solution.  Cause us to say, ‘I’m trying to heal my pain, not worsen it’. Think of it like a dislocated shoulder - extremely painful in itself, and in order to heal it, it MUST be relocated - which will temporarily add to the pain.⁠
⁠
💜So what pain have you been avoiding that may actually lead to a lessening of your pain in the long run?  Are you ready to dip your toe in? ⁠

And then the fear sets in... and fear is the part of chronic pain that really eats away at you.  What if this doesn’t go away?  What if this is your new reality?  What if you can’t go for a run?

#Backpain is affected by so many things and during this pandemic I’ve had a lot more patients complaining of back pain. Some reasons for this could include:⁠
🤔Stress & anxiety resulting in a fight/flight response which increases muscle tension and pain,⁠
🤔Lack of movement due to working from home and so the morning commute or walking to the toilet/coffee shop/or getting out for lunch,⁠
🤔Sustained postures at the desk, even if it’s a good posture or a standing desk. We’re not made to stay still for long periods of time (check my stories to see a 2 minute desk stretch you can do yourself at home).⁠
.⁠
Try this flow a couple of times per day even if you haven’t got back pain, as it can be a good preventative.⁠
.⁠
In our @strengththroughyoga eguides we include both mind and body exercises which can help common issues such as back pain. We also have our new short guide “Mindfulness & Connection Toolkit” recently released, providing audio and video meditations to help with stress and anxiety further. If you have back pain and had a recent trauma, any other unusual symptoms, it’s not improving or it’s worsening then please see/speak with a health professional.⁠

This is a really cool twisting pose. If you notice the pictures, my left tricep is on the outside of my knee and the same hand is twisted back around my bent right leg. And then I’ve held onto my right palm, which I’ve extended behind my back. 

Shoulders are in one line from front to back, so you can only see the front shoulder. And the chest and stomach are pulled out from the side. 

What makes this pose cool is the not physical mobility required for it, but the after effects of the pose. 

Try it out. Enjoy that squeeze to your abdominal region, which squeezes your stomach and other digestive organs. A good internal squeeze of your digestive organs helps enhance your digestion and removes toxins easily. 
Twists like these help your spine maintain their natural mobility and prevent common back aches. 

Give it a shot. If you’re reading this you are welcome to ask me any questions you have on the pose. 

Twist like pretzels my friends. 🥨

Read our latest blog post:",2020-08-10 15:01:25,"Have you noticed that your child’s screen time and sitting time have increased lately? Sitting for longer periods of time, coupled with poor posture associated with phone and tablet use, can have a negative impact on developing spines. ⠀
⠀
We are already seeing the impact prolonged screen time has on children in terms of poor posture habits. While the use of technology can be a learning tool and a skill for children, it is important that they learn good habits to protect their spine. Here are 4 tips to help reduce the negative impacts of screen time:⠀
⠀
1. Limit Screen Time ⏰⠀
For children under the age of 2, healthcare professionals generally recommend avoiding screen time altogether (with the exception of live video chats with family and friends). After the age of 2, it is recommended to limit screen time to less than 1 hour a day, broken down into 2 half-hour sessions. This is because, after 30 minutes, the muscles that support your child’s spine begin to fatigue, making the child more prone to slouch. As children get older, continue to place consistent limits and establish screen-free zones and times of day.⠀
⠀
2. Standing Desk🧍🏽‍♀️⠀
If your child spends time on a computer or laptop at home, set them up with a standing desk. This will help keep the core and back muscles engaged, taking the stress off of the smaller muscles of the neck. ⠀
⠀
3. Talk to Your Child About Posture🗣⠀
Children like to know the reasons why they should/shouldn’t do something. Explain in simple terms the effects of poor posture on their spine and overall health. Make them aware of what good posture is and remind them to self-correct if they are slouching.⠀
⠀
4. Take Stretch Breaks Together 🤸🏻⠀
Practice stretching and moving with your children. Chances are, you also spend too much time in front of screens and could benefit from a stretch break. Put down the devices and get up and move around.⠀
 ⠀
Movement isn’t just important for muscle development and expending energy. Movement of the spine sends information to the brain that is essential for brain and nervous system development. In most cases, movement doesn’t happen behind a screen. So keep your kids moving, playing, and growing",4,1,False,
369,GraphImage,islandbreezechiropractic,"Injured in an Auto accident, neck pain, low back pain, sports injury ...Call Dr. Latoya Evans, D.C at 954-720-3002! She’s got your back!",2020-08-10 15:01:24,"Backpacks offer a practical way for your child to carry all they need (and some of what they don’t) to and from school each day. It helps to distribute the sometimes heavy loads of schoolbooks across the back and shoulders. The biggest health risk for your child is overload, which can lead to strain of the neck, shoulders, and back. Your child’s backpack should be worn properly (over both shoulders) at all times and never exceed 15% of his/her body weight. This is ideal in order to avoid any potential health issues. ⠀

We need to breathe to live. And the fact is that your brain and body will sacrifice everything to continue to live. ⁣
⁣
What people do not realize is that there are right and wrong ways to breathe. ⁣
⁣
For example, a lot of people are ""chest breathers"", when breathing they use the muscles of their neck and shoulders to pull up their rib cage.  Their chest rises and falls with each breath.  This is wrong. ⁣
⁣
What is ideal is ""belly breathing"". Using your diaphram (breathing muscle) to pull downwards into your belly and bringing pressure all the way down to your pelvis.  This is the right way to breathe. ⁣
⁣
When we belly breathe it automatically creates pressure inside your abdomen, which causes the muscles to counteract that pressure. This protects your spine by creating more stability, without even having to think about it! ⁣
⁣
There are so many effects that how your breathe can haves on your body so stay tuned for my posts later this week to learn more. ⁣

De novo scoliosis: when scoliosis strikes the elderly!
The type of elderly scoliosis, also called degenerative or de novo,  has always existed, but only recently been identified as distinct form. It appears from the age of 50-60 years onwards and is associated with often marked clinical symptoms. Albeit of only mild-moderate severity, this form causes pronounced forward and/or lateral bending of the back because the general stiffness associated with aging means that affected subjects fail to develop the compensatory curves that would have the effect of straightening their back.
It is absolutely the most frequent type of scoliosis: according to some studies it affects up to 30% of all people aged over 70 with no previous history of vertebral abnormalities, it typically appears at lumbar level resulting in a sudden and rapid formation of a curve in a previously perfectly straight back leaving them centimetres shorter and needing to hold on to something to stay upright.

RDT is a powerful technique using essential oils that was developed by D Gary Young (Young Living founder) in the 1980s. It combines several modalities to bring balance and transformation.

This technique involves applying therapeutic grade essential oils to the spine, neck and feet. A session will last about an hour but the benefits may last about a week or more!

Most importantly RDT is non invasive and suitable for all ages. You can also do it at home for your loved ones - love and care make a huge different when it comes to therapy.

I fell in love right away. I know you will too!

👇 WORK WITH ME",2020-08-10 14:53:13,"Here are a couple quick stretches for you if you are sitting more than usual and more specifically finding you have tightness on one side of the body.

My regular Fascial Stretch clients tend to need more treatment on the Lateral Line of the body from sitting, driving, etc and leaning more toward one side.

These are some great stretches you can execute multiple times daily for relief of lower back and shoulder tightness.

The first requires your bodyweight only and can be done on a door frame at home.

The second two add the traction of a heavy resistance band. I find the assistance of the heavy band allows you to sit deeper and more relaxed into the stretch.

⏬Thoracic Spine Mobility [P]Rehab Program Live❗️⏬",2020-08-10 14:52:20,"⁣🚨THORACIC SPINE MOBILITY OVERHAUL [P]REHAB PROGRAM NOW LIVE🚨⁣
⁣
🔥The Thoracic Spine Mobility Overhaul [P]Rehab Program is the ultimate resource for those looking to improve their thoracic spine mobility. If your thoracic spine mobility is limited and your entire upper body is paying for it, this program will get you moving better and feeling better! We have blended science with our clinical expertise and experience to guide you towards improving your mobility in just weeks!⁣
⁣
‼️Learn more through the link in bio! ⁣
⁣
✅Thoracic mobility is so important because it is basically the intersection of your spine and your body. So many moving parts rely on optimal thoracic mobility - your neck, your shoulders, your ribs, your low back, and let’s not forget your entire torso relies on the fact that your thoracic spine can move and that it can move well! Without adequate motion in the right places, you run the risk of exposing other body regions to excessive strain due to compensatory movement strategies.⁣
⁣
➡️Yet, the average person is bound to be stiff and limited in this region and the rest of their mid back! We can blame 21st-century workplaces and lifestyle habits, but blaming isn’t going to resolve anything, it’s time for you to take action! Our goal with this program is to provide you with what you need to know to take control of your own health. You will get access to what we believe is an effective formula for improving mobility, but you’ll also gain access to us if you need help along the way!⁣

21 years of understanding pain, from breaking my spine, and more.
There are ways to get through it",2020-08-10 14:36:51,"⭐️ Habits of the mind (your thought processes) and habits of the body (what you do and don’t do) go hand in hand. 

⭐️ Become aware of what you think in regards to exercising. 

⭐️ Put a note pad by your bedside or kitchen. Write down the excuses you give yourself and then counter them. 

⭐️ Some of my examples are:

1. I can’t exercise in the evening because I will be too alert and won’t be able to sleep. 
Countered with, exercise in the morning then. 

2. I can’t exercise in the morning, because I just ate and now I have things to do. 
Countered with, exercise first thing in the morning before I even eat. I wear exercise clothing as PJs so I don’t have to convince myself into getting dressed for it. 

3. I am too tired.
Countered with, exercising routinely increases your energy. You also sleep better at night time. 

4. I am too sore. 
Countered with, warming up your muscles and stretching decreases your pain. It increases your range of motion and decreases your tension. 

5. I don’t feel like doing it. 
Countered with, that is just a feeling. Take your “I don’t feel like doing it” attitude to the stationary bike with you. You will enjoy the feeling of accomplishment. 

⭐️ By becoming aware of your thought habits you will have the power to remove roadblocks standing in your way. And then you will develop new physical habits that you action. 

It is easy to forget that what we think contributes to what we do and don’t do.

I am sitting here trying to think myself out of exercising all ready. My excuse is that I want to clean the house and everyone is sleeping. 
Countered with, fine. Clean until the kids wake up. But, when they get up, get on the bike right away. Boo. I am a little annoyed with myself, because I have no excuse.

Consistent exercise helps you:
- Lower risk of obesity, cancer, heart disease, diabetes and many other illnesses
- Lose, gain, or maintain weight
- Improve resistance to infections
- Gain high-quality sleep
- Help to balance emotional health
- Prevent and relieve chronic pain
- Exercise increases size of hippocampus and improves memory
- Increase blood and oxygen flow to your brain
- Release accumulated toxins through better blood circulation
- Increase blood flow supplying nutrients necessary to keep brain cells healthy
- Improve your brain function

Tai Chi, yoga and qigong are all methods that increase the flow of energy ( and blood flow) within the body improving health and well-being.

The skin can be mapped throughout the body to show the related sensory nerve that supplies a particular zone. If an irritation to a particular nerve occurs, pain or even a rash may occur in the associated region. 

When symptom patterns stay within the borders or a region it can point towards a nerve pathology (as opposed to vascular for example). Sometimes viruses - such as that which causes shingles - will remain dormant in nerve ganglia and if expressed, will exhibit symptoms in the corresponding dermatome. 

The nerve itself travels to the region of the body exiting off the back of the spinal cord (motor nerves, required for ‘action’ not ‘feeling’ edit the front and the two branches merge to form the nerve exiting the spinal canal). This is yet another reason why spinal health is so fundamental to nerve health. If there is dysfunction at particular spinal levels it is more likely you will see symptoms related to the nerves of the same level. This is also why foot pain or knee pain may in fact be a spinal issue and not a localized problem.

Some of the more obvious reasons to see a Chiropractor include chronic lower back pain, tension headaches and of course, car accidents. However, you don’t need to be in physical pain to get a chiropractic adjustment. Simply wanting to live a healthier life can be enough. As your Chiropractor, we can give you health guidance, exercise routines and more.

If you are experiencing any of these symptoms or know that you need to make some lifestyle adjustments, come see us at our main location, The Paulk Clinic, in Stockbridge, GA.  Not in the area?

The type of elderly scoliosis, also called degenerative or de novo,  has always existed, but only recently been identified as distinct form. It appears from the age of 50-60 years onwards and is associated with often marked clinical symptoms. Albeit of only mild-moderate severity, this form causes pronounced forward and/or lateral bending of the back because the general stiffness associated with aging means that affected subjects fail to develop the compensatory curves that would have the effect of straightening their back.
It is absolutely the most frequent type of scoliosis: according to some studies it affects up to 30% of all people aged over 70 with no previous history of vertebral abnormalities, it typically appears at lumbar level resulting in a sudden and rapid formation of a curve in a previously perfectly straight back leaving them centimetres shorter and needing to hold on to something to stay upright.

443,GraphImage,dr.roquepainreliefcenter,Interventional Pain Management,2020-08-10 14:19:47,"HOW TRANSLAMINAR EPIDURAL INJECTIONS  can give YOU PAIN RELIEF!!
Because the Neck and upper back/thoracic spine area of the spinal column has a great deal of stability and limited movement, upper back pain is far less common. When it does occur, it can cause significant discomfort. Muscular irritation (myofascial pain) and joint dysfunction are often the cause of upper back pain.

Chronic  back pain can also be treated by TRANSLAMINAR  EPIDURAL INJECTIONS of steroids combined with local anesthetics such as lidocaine. Targeting nerves in back  regions, which control pain transmission from the back, may be useful in controlling chronic pain.

Acute cases of Neck and upper back pain may be caused by muscle damage. This can be associated with accidents, playing sports, or poor posture. When muscles are damaged, inflammatory molecules are released by the immune system, which causes pain. Inflammation is also caused by conditions such as arthritis, which may also cause damage to thoracic vertebrae (spinal bones) or the ribs. Pain is also associated with damage to the joints between vertebrae in the upper back (known as facet joints). More long-term sources of upper back pain may be DISC HERNIATION OR BULGING. Discs are rings of tissue located between each bone of the spine for support and shock absorption. Bulging occurs if the discs break down and bulge outwards, causing constant pain.
CAUSES OF UPPER BACK PAIN

Today, patient underwent a Transforaminal epidural procedure to treat her severe and incapacitating Neck  Pain . She got immediate pain relief!

RDT is a powerful technique using essential oils that was developed by D Gary Young (Young Living founder) in the 1980s. It combines several modalities to bring balance and transformation.

This technique involves applying therapeutic grade essential oils to the spine, neck and feet. A session will last about an hour but the benefits may last about a week or more!

Most importantly RDT is non invasive and suitable for all ages. You can also do it at home for your loved ones - love and care make a huge different when it comes to therapy.

REPOST: Pain or stiffness is common in this region and even more so in our current situation. Sitting in irregular positions all day if you are working from home, watching TV or even playing video games can all contribute to this issue. 

-

These exercises can help with mobility in this localised area. If spinal segments lack movement they can become stiff leading to pain and reduced functionality.

Pain is a signal sent from the body for you to interpret. ⁣
⁣
It is telling you that something needs attention…⁣
⁣
But it can be challenging to interpret these signals. They come across as something foreign and upsetting. It is a natural response to be afraid of—or even angry at—something we don’t understand, so the logical next step is to learn how to understand it.⁣
⁣
Pain is your body’s language.⁣
⁣
It gives you clues about your emotional and mental state just as much as your physical state.⁣
⁣
And even more than that, pain gives you clues to the truth… to the deep root cause… to the “why” of your overall state of being.⁣

- Ingrown toenails are a common problem, especially on the big toes. They arise if the toenail grows into the skin next to it. That area becomes inflamed and painful.
- The medical term for ingrown toenails is onychocryptosis or unguis incarnatus.
- They are more likely to occur if you wear tight shoes, have very sweaty feet, or cut your toenails the wrong way. 
- Ingrown toenails cause the affected skin to become inflamed. The blood supply to that part of the toe increases, and it becomes red, swollen and painful.
- Sometimes new tissue starts growing over the toenail. Doctors call this a granuloma, because the surface of the new tissue looks a bit like tiny granules. The inflamed area may weep, bleed or release pus and have an unpleasant odor  especially if bacteria get into the wound.

The focus this week is groins & deep hips. 

The frog & side split are going to be our isolation mobilisations before we move into the strengthening movement.

This is a form I find particularly effective as it first isolates the joint with a mobilisation to help increase the range, which in turn reduces the sensitivity and protection around the joint. Before moving into an exercise to make the nervous system more aware of the range whilst building strength through that movement.

This is a system I will use with a lot of my clients at the start and find it very effective in getting them more comfortable with their body and what it can do.

If the body is uncomfortable it will do its best to protect itself, therefore by letting it know you are able to reach that point safely first, the nervous system will allow you to move into those corners and build on them.

Keeping everything slow & controlled at the start helps the body adapt as it feels fit. It’s the long process of pushing the boundary an inch at a time, safely and consistently, that will get you where you want.

RDT is a powerful technique using essential oils that was developed by D Gary Young (Young Living founder) in the 1980s. It combines several modalities to bring balance and transformation.

This technique involves applying therapeutic grade essential oils to the spine, neck and feet. A session will last about an hour but the benefits may last about a week or more!

Most importantly RDT is non invasive and suitable for all ages. You can also do it at home for your loved ones - love and care make a huge different when it comes to therapy.

I fell in love right away. I know you will too!

Your organs are in perpetual motion. Breathing, walking and stretching all create internal movement. In a healthy body, the fluid movements are transmitted through the fascia to other structures. Organs lose mobility due to physical trauma, surgery, infection, diet, posture, etc. The restrictions lead to compensation, tension, and irritation.⠀

👍 Training through injury and pain. 
👇 For online programming apply below.",2020-08-10 13:37:03,"For some people, the lockdown was a welcome break, a time to unwind, connect with friends and family and slow down. I know a lot of people who found it quite enjoyable.

For others of us, those living alone or with kids, it was anything but enjoyable.

I'm in the latter camp, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a net positive.

As with any challenging experience, it's how you approach it that matters.

The first six weeks of lockdown I was forced to put my degree to the back of my mind and work solely on adapting my business to be entirely virtual. 

Lots of emails, communicating with existing clients and setting up Zoom integrations came first. 

But then I invested in a coaching course on how to take a fitness business online.

Thanks, @sukhsidhu.

This changed everything. 

Over the last three months, I have developed and honed a new way of working, one that will never replace what I was doing before but that I intend to keep alongside it.

Working with clients purely virtually was something I had considered before, but not something I had pursued. The lockdown forced my hand and I'm so glad it did. 

Why?

Because it works bloody well. 

My clients get all their workouts programmed for them. 

We're in contact all the time, as much as they need, as well as having weekly scheduled check-ins. 

They're all getting results and progressing towards their goals, overcoming injuries or getting strong and flexible as hell, all without necessarily having to be in the same place at the same time. 

They can fit their workouts around their schedule. They can do them at home, with whatever equipment they have available, with access to their coach all the time. 

The value for money compared to the standard 1-2-1 model of PT is ridiculous. 

So now I have this new way of working, it means I can still do 1-2-1 treatment and PT sessions, but I don't need to be doing split shifts every day. 

Split shifts are exhausting. 

So this is a better, more sustainable way of working for me as well.

It's a win-win.

🙌🏻 Often, the onset of acute Low Back Pain (LBP) is very sudden, unexpected and painfull.  A very strong, piercing pain suddenly appears in the area of the lumbar spine. Due to this shooting pain, movement is initially restricted or not possible at all ❗Even the smallest movement is so painful that the affected people remain in a bent-over position. A very agonizing situation for those affected 🥵 This is exactly what happened to my team member @jay.perez_
There can be multiple causes of LBP. It can be also triggered by everyday stress on the spine during exercises and general daily activities.  𝐈𝐧𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐦𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐢𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐦𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐨𝐧 𝐜𝐚𝐮𝐬𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐚𝐜𝐮𝐭𝐞 𝐥𝐨𝐰 𝐛𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐩𝐚𝐢𝐧. It is very often caused by prolonged sitting 🖥️
⠀
Due to the severity of the back pain, a herniated disc is often assumed as the cause. This condition, however, is rarely responsible for low back pain.

As ALWAYS a COMPLETE and THOROUGH examination must be performed in order to diagnose the true cause and choose the appropriate treatment‼️
Often, the initial treatment of ACUTE LBP focuses on pain relief. It can be achieved by anti-inflammatory painkillers as well as medication for the  muscle cramps 💊 Additionally, slow movements, cold/heat treatment can be utilized.
⠀
However, right after the pain became bearable and RJ was able to move he came to see me. To receive CHIROPRACTIC treatment! To address the true cause - lumbar spine joint fixation ☝️
He is doing much better now and is ready to help me to prepare and deliver this information to all of you. I hope it is useful and helpful 🙏

Scoliosis tips 💚 Spinal Fusion 💜⠀
⠀
💚 this is a great one for upper body and core strength. Make sure to push the floor away with the hands (the space between the shoulder blades will widen), keeping the front ribs in and slightly tuck your tailbone especially if you tend to dip in the lower back. Lengthen through the crown of the head and tailbone. ⠀
⠀
💚Thoracic curves: notice if you tend to push through the arm of your convex side more than the other! Think about keeping the collarbone on that side wide and open and push a little more with the arm on the concave side. ⠀

💜spinal fusion: no special considerations. Just make sure the head is in line with the rest of the spine⠀

RDT is a powerful technique using essential oils that was developed by D Gary Young (Young Living founder) in the 1980s. It combines several modalities to bring balance and transformation.

This technique involves applying therapeutic grade essential oils to the spine, neck and feet. A session will last about an hour but the benefits may last about a week or more!

Most importantly RDT is non invasive and suitable for all ages. You can also do it at home for your loved ones - love and care make a huge different when it comes to therapy.

Flexion distraction can help with a number of conditions, including sciatica pain, arthritis, lower back stiffness, spondylolisthesis (a crack or stress fracture in one of the vertebrae), spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal), scoliosis, and sacroiliac syndrome.

____________________________________________

🔥 A common pain generator that is quite frequently overlooked is the sacroiliac joint!

🤔 How do we figure out when the SIJ is the pain generator? There are several different ways, two of the most common include Laslett’s Criteria (group of orthopedic tests with high Sp/Sn) and the other is through motion palpation(testing the movement of the specific joint). Both of which are very well researched and highly accurate!

🚨 The SI joints are a common area for many tendons and ligaments. That means there are several structures that can have effect on the SI joint and vice versa. That is why is important to keep this area moving and strong!!

A critical component of playing sports pain-free is wearing custom-made foot orthotics. Your feet are your foundation, after all. Pronation, arch collapse, or even unsupported high arches can leave you vulnerable to pain and injury. Custom Feet Insoles has done research showing the positive effects of athletes wearing orthotics during their sport. From reducing football injuries, creating some improvement of a vertical leap, and improving balance and proprioception in golfers, our orthotics have been shown to have positive effects for athletes.

I’m Dr. Brad Chmelar, the chiro here at Accident Care of Beaverton. Although I have been manning this clinic since May, I have worked at our Portland locations since 2018, seeing numerous MVC patients since then. In addition, I previously had my own private sports medicine based practice. Here are a few things to get to know me a little better:
-I’m a native of Texas but have been in Oregon almost 8 years now.
-I was college football player at Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, TX. @sfa_football 
-I learned to ski for the first time in the last few years and am now proficient enough to ski blues! 
-My wife and I have an eight year old Thai Bangkaew Dog named Stevie who we adopted two years ago from the Elephant Nature Park in Chiang Mai, Thailand, where she lives for four years amongst hundreds of dogs at their rescue and amongst formerly abused and captive elephants. (@elephantnatureparkdogs)

Hopefully in the time ahead I can provide some tips for keeping your musculoskeletal health in order, along with educational moments on all sorts of subjects, especially as it relates to being injured in an MVC. I’m an open book, so fee free to send me any questions you may have or just to say hello!

Back to outdoor stretching and mobility work today so that I can enjoy some of the sunshine ☀️🌸

This Oblique stretch will help those sat at their desk 💻 as well as Pregnant Ladies 🤰🏼 

People who lead a more sedentary life tend to have tighter obliques as our spine gets stuck in flexion when we sit, obstructing the obliques and reducing mobility. 

Those with an anterior pelvic tilt (when the pelvis tilts forward, arching the back - this often occurs during pregnancy as baby grows) have weak obliques, resulting in back and hip pain 🙌🏻

Therefore this stretch will help to prevent and ease those other tensions 💪🏻

After the treatment from 24 to 25 doctors when there was no relief in back pain. 
This lockdown i saw some medical reports n x-rays of my mother. 

After diagnose i found that it could be LUMBAR LORDOSIS and some MUSCLE STIFFNESS. 

So i put her on 'Intermittent Fasting' 
and started her Lower back, Hip flexors and Hamstring n all other tight muscles STRETCHING on a daliy basis. 
And some evening jogging. 

After 2 months she lost almost 5kg KG of weight, 
And her Lower Back Pain was quite far better thn earlier.  Her posture is now also better thn earlier. 

Due to lack of proper physical activity and Unhealthy Eating Habit, 
We lost our Muscle Strength and Bone Mineral Density AND
Slower down our Metabolism. 

Everyone Should engage urself in any physical activities And
keep track of what you Eat.

RDT is a powerful technique using essential oils that was developed by D Gary Young (Young Living founder) in the 1980s. It combines several modalities to bring balance and transformation.

This technique involves applying therapeutic grade essential oils to the spine, neck and feet. A session will last about an hour but the benefits may last about a week or more!

Most importantly RDT is non invasive and suitable for all ages. You can also do it at home for your loved ones - love and care make a huge different when it comes to therapy.

Our autonomic nervous system is made up of the connection from our brain and spinal cord to our major organs.

The positive is that your conditioning will improve over time, but the negative is that you're frequently training at a high intensity to attempt to beat your previous time for every run. Adding these intense running sessions to your intense training sessions at the gym may result in overtraining.⁠
⁠
I personally like to mix up the conditioning sessions for my athletes by programming high intensity interval training and lower intensity distance sessions. They get the benefits of improving their conditioning while minimizing their risk for overtraining 🔑⁠

What's a good way to know how intense your sessions are? A HR monitor is a great tool to track your training intensity!⁠

💛🌿 Young Living Essential Oils",2020-08-10 12:58:20,"RAINDROP TECHNIQUE (RDT)

RDT is a powerful technique using essential oils that was developed by D Gary Young (Young Living founder) in the 1980s. It combines several modalities to bring balance and transformation.

This technique involves applying therapeutic grade essential oils to the spine, neck and feet. A session will last about an hour but the benefits may last about a week or more!

Most importantly RDT is non invasive and suitable for all ages. You can also do it at home for your loved ones - love and care make a huge different when it comes to therapy.

I fell in love right away. I know you will too!

I started my care in April and I foresee continuing treatment even after I’m done with my initial treatment because I understand that chiropractic care is my new normal. I have never been a morning person, I dragged. Now I am awake by 7:30 without an alarm, full of energy and off all meds. I can’t wait to see what other wins I experience after further treatment!

Specially this year, with all that we have been going through, mentally, emotionally, physically - the body, in shock, can and will hold on to pain a bit longer than it needs to. 

If you are living in Miami, I can help you resolve and ease your pain. I know many people are still scared of going out, so I will come to you. 

With a global health crisis, our attention and focus has increased to strengthening the body. 

Holistic Medicine is a natural way of helping the body as a whole - understanding the interdependence that each system has with each other - and helping the body to heal itself; without the need of forcing the body with harsh “medicines”

🔥🤟🤟 . Esta é uma maneira de fazer o teimoso QL se acalmar um pouco, especialmente se o alongamento regular não está funcionando para você! .
🔛 O QL freqüentemente compensa excessivamente as discrepâncias no nível do quadril ou sobrecarrega os glúteos fracos! . Freqüentemente o culpado pela baixa tensão nas costas, esse movimento de mobilidade coloca o músculo em uma posição mais curta e, em seguida, coloca o músculo em um estado alongado ao máximo para ajudar a reduzir a tensão. .
📌 Fazer com que os músculos experimentem todo o espectro de seus movimentos é a melhor maneira de redescobrir o que é ""estado neutro"" para os músculos. . Experimente este movimento e compartilhe com seus amigos✌️ que estão com tensão nas costas! .

El landmine es una herramienta poderosa por su increíble versatilidad y por tender un puente entre ejercicios sencillos y sus progresiones en barra, ya sea presses, remos, sentadillas o pesos muertos, como es el caso.

Este ha sido uno de los ejercicios en mi rutina de hoy. Con el landmine trabajo de forma más sencilla el gesto facilitando la transición entre fase excéntrica y concéntrica y permitiéndome coger un peso aceptable. 

Pruébenlo y si le cogen el truco, será una herramienta que querrán incorporar en casi todas las sesiones!!

I have had many massages In the past and I would highly recommend Lorrin to anyone who wants immediate attention to problem areas. She has a therapeutic way of getting at the deep tissue and really working the trigger areas in a variety of techniques. She is very strong and uses her whole body to lean in for deep work. She respected my request for no/limited talking and really focused on deep tissue massage for my problem areas. I will definitely go back to Lorrin again!” - RVD
This is Lorrin, she is incredibly grounded in who she is and her bodywork reflects that.
Lorrin loves working with all things back, from neck and shoulder to lower back issues her offers deep tissue manual massage therapy with results. 
Lorrin works Tuesday-Saturday. Typically with evening availability. To book with Lorrin or any of our other massage therapists visit our website! TakeCareBoone.com, link in bio!

-
A perfect example of this is giving out foot orthoses. You might think that pronation might be a contributing factor OR a way in to alleviate someones symptoms when they are suffering from different types of foot/ankle pain.
-
However, giving an insole to try and reduce levels of pronation (kinematics) is not an intervention that has a consistent outcome!
-
In fact, some people can even pronate MORE with these insoles!
-
What often does change is the kinetics or forces going through the soft tissues, which if reduced, might be a reason for why people can get pain relief.
-
Have a look and see if you’re familiar with these aspects of biomechanics!

The good news is that in most cases, it can be resolved with physiotherapy and specific exercises.
However, some symptoms can be more serious. If you have pins and needles, numbness or weakness in one or both legs, or if you have sudden trouble with bladder or bowel control, contact your physiotherapist or GP immediately.

The most common cause of back pain is sitting for long periods in a poor position. See our post of 8 June 2020 for simple advice to improve sitting posture.

You do not need to live as a machine by following the same busy, hectic routine every day. It’s physically and mentally good to have a lazy day. While your body needs physical activities to remain active and healthy, the rest is also equally essential. Doing nothing for the whole day brings a lot of positive impacts on your physical health by giving relaxation and allowing your body the chance to restore and rebuild.

🚨 Before running that half marathon, trying to show your friends you ""still got it"" on the basketball court, or attempting to test your 1-rep-max in the bench press after just setting foot into the gym for the first time since high school, think about what your body is prepared to handle!
-
🛑 This doesn't only apply to relatively sedentary folks or those who DON'T exercise all that often, but also for those who have been training consistently for a while but not in a way that PREPARES them for the DEMANDS of their new activity or sport they just started
-
🗝 The key, as always, is to PREPARE the body for the stresses, energy system requirements, and movements that relate to the new activity and to do so in a GRADUAL and PROGRESSIVE manner
-
💪🏼 This is what we in the Fitness, Performance, and Rehab industries lovingly refer to as PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD and the concept of SPECIFICITY (or ""SAID"" Principle: Specific Adaptation to Imposed Demands)
-
🚨 Of course, there are STILL cases where individuals can become injured through circumstances outside of their control (e.g. contact injuries, slipping on a wet spot on the floor, etc). And chronically OVER-training can happen as well
-
💥 But, in a large amount of cases, poor PREPARATION and PLANNING leads to doing TOO MUCH, TOO FAST, and the body is not adequately prepared to handle the load(s) required, leading to injury
-
💯 This is why being PATIENT and having a solid PLAN in place are vital to improving your STRENGTH and RESILIENCE to injury
-
💥 It's not easy, but it will be worth your while!

.
Unless you fall off, cycling is a sport blessed by its body-friendliness! In fact, riding big miles is more likely to get you fit than fractured. But like any endurance sport, cycling can produce a catalogue of boggling aches and pains. Here we discover 7 of the most common cycling ailments, their most likely causes and how to go about fixing them.
.
There are two main types of injury, those who fall off (which we don’t explore here) and the issues caused by overtraining, biomechanical stresses, often due to muscle imbalances, and incorrect bike set-up. It is particularly important for the sake of future injury and prevention to identify the root cause and it address it ASAP.
.
Many cycling overuse injuries can be prevented, remember A-B-C. Be assessed for underlying issues such as muscle weaknesses, flexibility, leg length discrepancy and flat feet. Then check you have the correct bike setup, correct technique and cycling posture. Finally, condition yourself with appropriate strengthening and stretching exercises and profess your training moderately and always listen to your body!",13,1,False,

Here are some great cues that I use to teach clients especially new mums that may have a tummy separation (diastasis) or pelvic floor dysfunction. Or those with chronic low back pain.

These exercises teach you to engage the deep abdominals and the pelvic floor as you EXHALE SLOWLY AND FULLY WITH SOUND (a shhhhh or huhhh)

They may look simple but can be tricky to prevent other muscles and joints getting involved.

Try 5-10 x each with a relaxation on the inhale and a drawing up of the pelvic floor and in with the belly button on the exhale. 

1. Seated half roll back - really scoop out the belly on the exhale and engage.

2. Supine imprint - focus on gently imprinting the lower ribs and back into the floor (avoid tucking pelvis or squeezing glutes)

3. Use a block to find your core - press hands and knees into block whilst imprinting on exhale

4. Table top vacuum - relax the tummy then on the exhale draw the belly button to the spine whilst rest of back and pelvis stays still. Try and hold belly up for 5-20secs.

5. Prone belly lifts - visuals the bellybutton lifting away from the floor without the pelvis tucking or bottom squeezing!

Persevere with these as it can take time to coordinate the breathing and engaging of the pelvic floor but once you’ve cracked it you have the foundations in place to really build a great body!! 

Have a look at my YouTube channel link in my linktree in my Bio above, where I cover a lot of these exercises in my 15 min core class.👍.

Great advice from Luke @lukewalkerphysio here!

As I type this, I'm frantically straightening up—but most of the day, I'm not thinking about it and end up reverting to a hunched position.
While yes, thinking about it and consciously trying to break the habit is important, so is building back and shoulder strength.

When your back and shoulders are strong, holding them up just feels easier. (A strong core is important here too, which includes your lower back). 

Combined with some mental reminders to stop slouching, building strength can help improve your posture over time.

Also, having a strong back and shoulders helps you do a lot of everyday things better. Your back is a huge muscle group, and you use it every time you push or pull anything—that includes something as simple as lifting things up and taking things down from a high shelf. Or pushing a revolving door. Everyday activities like these are easier when your back is strong.

In addition, back pain is the single leading cause of disability, preventing people from work and everyday activity 🙇‍♂️

Of course, everyone is different and there could be many causes of back pain. You can probably guess one of the main causes:

🔥 Poor posture 🔥
🔥 Ineffective work equipment including a chair with poor lumbar support 🔥

Incorporating a few changes in your work space and work routine can really help improve back pain 💆‍♀️

Book your next massage and you’ll already feel better.

Massage helps to relieve pain, stiffness , inflammation etc. But it also helps to reduce stress which in turn can help with the items listed above.

It’s important to set time aside for yourself, to take care of yourself, even when you feel too busy.

Take a moment.

Deep breath.

•
Going into pregnancy 2, this was honestly something I wasn’t even aware of. I’d had some aches and pains during my first pregnancy, but put it down to normal pregnancy niggles.
Cue pregnancy 2 where by 18 weeks my lower back was already sore and I could feel my left hip grinding whenever I was on my feet and moving for any length of time.
I brought it to the attention of my midwife, but the opinion was that it was a multiple pregnancy and therefore there would be more pain earlier on. It was to be expected and I could take paracetamol to manage the pain - something I chose not to do - and a referral to a physiotherapist at the local hospital would be requested.
The pain got worse. It got to the point where it was taking me 2 days to recover from a day at work (I usually do quite a physical job with long hours and a bit of humphing). In those 2 days, my hip siezed up, I struggled to get out of bed and rolling over in bed was impossible. I couldn’t lift my toddler or play with her. Due to the earlier attitude towards the pain, I kept going. After all, this was normal. It was to be expected.
It got to week 32 of pregnancy and I couldn’t take it any more. I was barely sleeping due to the pain, walking any more than a few metres was agony and I was dreading how I was going to feel after doing any exercise or movement at all. My physio appointment confirmed that I was suffering from PGP, pelvic girdle pain. NOT normal during pregnancy and completely treatable. My physio gave me some ‘one size fits all’ exercises to do and sent me on my way. 
My consultant at the hospital basically brushed off the pain as again, being normal, and it would disappear by itself after the birth. It was hormone related (not true). 
I was feeling more and more frustrated as researching the pain myself seemed the only route to take. For me, my complaint  wasn’t being taken seriously. 
I started doing some gentle stretches and exercises but it actually seemed to make things worse so I stopped.
•
After having my babies, the pain continued. I tried to book a 6 week check at my GP and was told they weren’t doing them (Covid).

Often the high pain levels experienced are not reflective of the actual underlying problem. Meaning unless you have, for example, sustained a direct trauma falling onto your back, it is highly unlikely any structure has suddenly become ‘out of place’ or ‘misaligned’. 

Firstly you need to start moving your back as much or as little as you can tolerate to start building confidence, and then following a structured exercise programme back to full recovery. 

Online video consultations are ideal for meeting this need, as often ‘hands-on’ massage or manipulation is not required. By taking a detailed history and asking you specific questions, serious underlying conditions can be eliminated. Then a  bespoke exercise programme can be put together and delivered.

CBD appears not to attach to either, but instead to encourage your body to use more of it’s own cannabinoids this is called the entourage effect
 .
CBD is non-psychoactive

The biggest advantage of CBD is as a anti-inflammatory. CBD can help your muscles heal and recover faster. Additionally, CBD can also help you sleep better, which also leads to better rest and that means improved recovery times

Reflexology assists to improve nerve, circulation, blood, lymphatic flow, relaxing the body, reducing stress and enhancing wellbeing.

Reflexology is also good for reducing stress, which can sometimes exacerbate people’s perception of pain.  This is related to back pain because it can cause stress which leads to an increase in the pain level experienced. 

Conditions such as sciatica and arthritis are optimally treated by having twice monthly sessions. Other treatment plans, such as for osteoporosis and herniated discs, will vary depending on the level of pain experienced and the severity of the condition.

Best approach for back pain is working with your GP, exercise, chiropractic adjustments, reflexology and massage, incorporating a Wholistic approach.

Medically known as blood stasis, it means blood is not circulating as optimally as it could to all parts of your body.

This imbalance is caused by several factors such as;

1. Unhealthy & nutrient-deficient diet (e.g. too much sugar, excessive alcohol)

2. Lifestyle habits (e.g. too little sleep, lack of physical activity, or over-training causing muscle inflammation)

3. Emotional stress

4. Trauma

To help with blood stasis, you can;

a. Eat a balanced diet, reduce sugar & processed food
b. Exercise moderately 3-4 times weekly
c. Practice deep breathing
d. Warm compress over painful area
e. Get a massage
f. Go for cupping therapy

You can usually reach your own forearms and legs but for harder to reach places try a massage ball. Lacrosse balls or spikey balls can be positioned around your shoulders, next to your spine or under gluts and rolled around to provide massage. This picture has a regular spikey ball and a peanut shaped one. The bigger the ball the less intense the massage. 

One word of warning is to not over do it. If you are new to massage balls start gently and build up - if it is feeling bruised the next day you overdid it! Also, avoid using it over bony bits - keep to muscle areas. 

They are really great to massage the soles of feet after a long day and can be used to reduce plantar fascia tension.

Accept yourself, love yourself, and keep moving forward. If you want to fly, you have to give up what weighs you down.

🌞Most challenging part today was to get up at 5AM.
After yoga, i desided to stay and swim, thought will take bus at 10:40 from the beach to my accomodation, but i didn't know that from one beach to another where my bus stops is not 15mins by walk, it took 42 mins for me under this burning sun 🏖️ and the bus didn't come at all. I had to take a taxi, when i could take it from the first beach without walking so far.

For me it's impossible to go out and everything goes as planned. Always should be something unexpected 🤣🤣🤣

🌞Самым тяжёлым было проснуться в 5утра. 
А после йоги решила поплавать, думала возьму автобус в 10:40 до моего аккомодейшн, но не тут то было... Я не знала, что с одного пляжа до другого, где мой автобус останавливается не 15мин пешком, а целых 42 минуты под этой палящей жарой. Но в итоге автобус таки не приехал. Пришлось взять такси здесь, когда я могла взять его ещё тааам... 

К чему я это? Вечно когда я куда-нибудь выхожу у меня неожиданные приключения...

-----
The front of our hip region where our core muscles and deep hip flexor muscles attach onto our hip bones is a region that can cause a ton of dysfunction.
-----
Too much sitting and/or poor food choices can lead to serious tightness.  Your job, if you are an esthetician,  can create a very tight hip flexor region and this can effect your legs, knees and feet.  As well as, your head, jaw, neck and diaphragm.
-----
I've been finding out that not many therapists actually get in this region to release the muscles and fascial adhesions leaving their clients with debilitating pain or dysfunction in all of the regions listed above.
------
Pain is merely a symptom of another area within the body that is not working optimally.  There are many reasons why certain areas will not work as well and that includes our thought processes, emotions, food choices but also our work position. 
------
Stretching is not enough in certain cases.  I especially see this in women who are extremely flexible.  They simply cannot get a good enough stretch.  The problem is that nerves become stuck in the pelvic region which means they cannot glide.  The fascia creates a lot of tension on the entire body and the pain cycle never stops.
------
Once the proper areas have been lengthened, appropriate ""re-training"" of the muscular system will be required to maintain its' new length.  If your job is creating the tension, you must make time throughout the day for short breaks to lengthen those tissues and/or re-inforce the longer/inhibited tissues.

Sleeping in one of these two positions can be extremely HELPFUL for those with lower back pain! 
.
.
When you sleep on your back, your lower back flattens, resulting in spinal flexion. It is important for us to maintain our neutral spine position.
Pillows can work wonders!! Try a pillow between your legs if you sleep on your side and try a small pillow under your back in sleep facing up.

In early childhood our movement pattern is automatic, predictable, and genetically formed as the nervous system matures.

In adult life, often times we get stuck in a flexed based posture, mainly due to our nowadays lifestyle. Some muscles get tight, other muscles weak - causing pain and discomfort.

Exercising taking advantage of the pre-programmed postures we possess, in order to improve the quality of movement patterns and compensate the load of stress that our bodies deal with can be a great way to a healthier life.

🇧🇷 “Toda posição de desenvolvimento motor é uma posição de exercício ”. Pavel Kolar.

Na infância, nosso padrão de movimento é automático, previsível e geneticamente formado à medida que o sistema nervoso amadurece.

Na vida adulta, muitas vezes ficamos presos em uma postura baseada em flexão, principalmente devido ao nosso estilo de vida atual. Alguns músculos ficam tensos, outros ficam fracos - causando dor e desconforto.

Exercitar-se aproveitando as posturas pré-programadas que possuímos, de forma a melhorar a qualidade dos padrões de movimento e compensar a carga de stress que o nosso corpo enfrenta pode ser um óptimo caminho para uma vida mais saudável.

Is lower back pain normal in pregnancy?

It is very common to get backache or back pain during pregnancy, especially in the early stages, but that does not make it normal.

During pregnancy, the ligaments in your body naturally become softer and stretch to prepare you for labour. This can put a strain on the joints of your lower back and pelvis, which can cause back pain.

Are you having back pain? Come and consult with the Chiropractor who will help provide solutions to your backache.

• Что такое кинезиотейп?
Кинезиотейпы представляют собой эластичные клейкие ленты (пластыри), выполненные из 100% хлопка и покрытые гипоаллергенным клеящим слоем на акриловой основе, который активизируется при температуре тела.
⠀
• Для чего используют кинезиотейпы? 
 ⁃ уменьшение болевого синдрома повреждённого участка.
 ⁃ Достижения лимфодренажного эффекта
 ⁃ Коррекция положения тела ( постуральное тейпирование).
 ⁃ восстановление функциональной активности мышц, нормализация функции суставов и эластических свойств фасций, а так же предположительно сегментарное влияние на внутренние органы.
⠀
• Есть ли противопоказания для кинезиотейпирования?
Да! Кинезиотейп нельзя использовать!
 ⁃ На открытой ране!
 ⁃ При кожных инфекциях
 ⁃ При  глубоком тромбозе вен
 ⁃ При заболеваниях почек и острой сердечной недостаточности
 ⁃ При индивидуальной непереносимости.
⠀

Don’t be that therapist that ‘dis-ables’ patients: be the ENABLER. Any good therapist will give modifications or regressions to exercises that are causing someone pain. You don’t need to know fancy exercises, you just need to understand the anatomy and biomechanics of the human body.
.
Knee pain with squats is a common presentation. The cause of knee pain is multifactorial but ways to exercise around knee pain are simple. Change the load, alter the range of motion, modify the number of repetitions, or change the biomechanical demand of the exercise. I’ve been using this exercise for my telehealth clients who I know have ‘buggery’ knees (and they all happen to have knee dominant squat patterning and/or poor movement patterns to start with). Cue the patient to sit deep to the back of the chair and reach the arms long to counterbalance. Then try not to use momentum, lean forwards so the centre of gravity is over your feet and use your leg strength to stand up. This reduces the load on the knees by allowing the shins to remain relatively vertical. It’s still a squat, but there is more leverage through the hips rather than the knees.

(720) 851-2000,2020-08-10 08:36:52,"🥼 www.southdenverspine.com  As discs wear out, they tend to lose fluid and become less elastic. As a result, your cervical spine may become stiffer with time. Also, discs tend to lose height as they become less elastic. Much like a marshmallow which is compressed from the top and the bottom, discs often tend to “bulge” around the periphery once they become compressed. This gradual collapse and “bulging” is often at the root of disorders of the cervical spine, which may require surgical intervention. #southdenverspinerobotics #southdenverspine #herniateddisc #bulgingdisc #degenerativediscdisease #spinedegeneration #spinehealth #denver #denverspine #denverspinesurgery #spinecare #coloradospine #englewoodcolorado #denvertechcenter #denveryoga #denverfitness #coloradofitness #coloradohealth #covidsafebusiness #backpain #backrelief #spinereconstruction #coloradostrong #denvermom #denverdad #denverlawyer #coloradolawyer #spinelstevenuniverse #denvergyms #nakedtreemedia",7,0,True,55.0

1. Sciatica is a symptom NOT a diagnosis
2. Sciatica is NOT always caused by back pain.

Strengthening the back of your thighs will result is a greater ability for the sciatic nerve to slide and glide freely. So if you suffer from sciatica, give the above workout a crack.

⁣ ⠀
There are many health professionals out there that only use high-velocity manipulations to ‘re-align’ their patients.⁣ ⠀
⁣ ⠀
The idea that a simple adjustment is all you need to fix your pain is so outdated and is backed up by ZERO quality research!⁣ ⠀
⁣ ⠀
This subluxation theory comes from chiropractic origins, where joints are said to be “out of place” or partially dislocated.⁣ ⠀
⁣ ⠀
Patients are told that they are out of alignment, out of whack, crooked etc. when we know that evidence says this is bs.⁣ ⠀
⁣ ⠀
Don’t get me wrong, everyone loves a good click and they will often bring about short term pain relief for a patient.⁣ ⠀
⁣ ⠀
But if you aren’t identifying the true cause of the patient’s symptoms and creating an individualised program that focuses on active modalities (exercise), you’re not in the profession for the right reasons.⁣ ⠀
⁣ ⠀
Human beings are so complex! That’s why it has been so hard to replicate anything like us!⁣ ⠀
⁣ ⠀
4 clicks every week will not fix anything apart from that therapist’s Audi!⁣ ⠀
⁣ ⠀
So, if you have been seeing someone for months for regular adjustments and have not been given exercises to correct imbalances, weaknesses or faults, you’re wasting your money 💰 ⁣ ⠀

A minimum of 2.5 hours of moderate intensity physical activity per week. It is up to you how many days you want to exercise, but it is best to be active at least 3 days a week.

Setting aside time to hit the gym every day may seem difficult, but you can still get your daily dose of physical activity by incorporating exercise into your daily routine. Follow simple steps

⏺️Five minute morning wake-up stretches
⏺️Active commuting to work 
⏺️Do desk stretches to stay active at work
⏺️Walk more
⏺️Evening short exercise routine

Kann man etwas durch Schmerzen lernen? In meinem Fall durch Rückenschmerzen. Für die einen klar JA, für die Anderen NEIN. 
Geht man es an das dieser so schnell als möglich wieder verschwindet und geht wieder seinen Weg. Oder gibt es ein Wandel. Schaust du genauer hin. Wieso, warum, gerade jetzt.
Dies kann auch im Kleinen sein. Kopfschmerzen und ich nimm ein Medikament und der Schmerz geht. Und das gebe ich auch zu das dies auch bei mir schon vorgekommen ist. Es ist zum Beispiel unpassend, weil ich ein anspruchsvoller Tag vor mir habe. Dies finde ich auch in Ordnung, wenn es nicht zur Gewohnheit wird. Ist der Schmerz aber dauerhaft und hat dieser auch ein hohes Level erreicht, das meine Lebensqualität darunter leidet. Macht es dann Sinn tiefer das Problem anzugehen?
Die erste Reaktion von vielen ist, ja klar, aber machen die meisten dann etwas dafür? Meine Erfahrung ist leider das Gegenteil. Wie gesagt will ich nicht sagen das es bei mir nicht vorkommt das ich erst beim 3. oder 4. «hinfallen» die Massnahmen ergreife, aber es hat sich definitiv verändert.
 Was habe ich nun gelernt. Kurz gesagt, das wichtigste, hinterfragen was gerade in meinem Leben vor sich geht, was zu dieser Reaktion in meinem Körper führt. Oder auch, ist es etwas von meiner Vergangenheit was mich Triggert. Hinhören und handeln. Ich war lange in einer Opferrolle und habe mich gefragt, wieso gerade passiert mir dies. Heute ist die Frage in mir anders, was kann ich tun, um das gewünschte zu erreichen. Und nochmals, ich muss auch hinfallen, um ins Handeln zu kommen. Aber beim 3mal ist handeln angesagt. 
Hörst du hin und handelst du danach?

Is your head sitting forward further than your shoulders?  Are your shoulders rounded forward? Is your mid back significantly rounded backwards?

•••

By far the most common cause of a stiff neck is a muscle strain or soft tissue sprain. In particular, the *LEVATOR SCAPULAE* muscle is susceptible to injury. Located at the back and side of the neck, the levator scapulae muscle connects the neck’s cervical spine with the shoulder. This muscle can become overused in activities such as computer work 💻, phone use 📱, activities where your head is being repetitively turned from side to side e.g. swimming 🏊🏽‍♀️, cycling 🚴🏼‍♀️ or driving 🚗, poor posture and slouching at a desk and excessive stress or anxiety. 

•••

How you manage the stiffness & pain can affect recovery time, pain levels and the likelihood of whether it will return. MASSAGE THERAPY is proven to be the most effective way of treating muscle strains and discomfort. By manipulating the soft tissue fibres and taking them to the therapeutic edge, we are able to influence and create new muscle memory and deactivate those tense and overactive muscles. Massage addresses lengthening short and weakened muscles and surrounding muscles that may have been compensating and will have been affected also.

.
In fact, research has shown IAP (Intra-abdominal pressure) values can increase when wearing a belt - which means more core tightness!✅
.
That being said, a weight belt is NOT designed to decrease or fix your back pain. Most people develop back pain when lifting due to poor movement quality & an inability to use their own “natural weightlifting belt” through proper core stability. Putting on a belt when you have back pain is like putting a band-aid on the problem - it does NOT address WHY you have developed the pain.
.
While our society preaches and tries to sell you on short term fixes for your problems. I’m here to tell you that is NOT how to find real lasting results. If you have back pain, you need to drop your ego & the weight and address why the issue started in the first place.

Sleeping in one of these two positions can be extremely HELPFUL for those with lower back pain! I love this visual.

When you sleep on your back, your lower back flattens, resulting in spinal flexion. It is important for us to maintain our neutral spine position.
Pillows can work wonders!! Try a pillow between your legs if you sleep on your side and try a small pillow under your back in sleep facing up.

Nalu is fine with other dogs, but I’m always a little careful when one person is allegedly controlling five dogs that are off lead.

Anyways, playing it safe I cut my cool down short. I’m doing four runs this week, so I’ll make it up later.

Disabled from degenerative spine. 1st surgery saved my life, the 2nd will address the actual cause of pain.🙏🏼❤️💪🏼🗝🔜🎹🎶",2020-08-10 05:29:59,"This is my first day that all the pain got worse and worse and wouldn’t give me a break. Today was a rollercoaster, and not very healing.

I moved and pushed myself like I always do. I had to take 2 showers to not lose myself to the pain. The water helps the internal bruising and lower back pain. Any movement right now hurts the surgery area of my spine though.

It feels like I have multiple knives in me twisting when I move. The main pain is definitely the spine, especially the mid back and lower back.

I’m trying my best. At least I took a few naps last night.

I see the surgeon soon to see what he thinks. It’s so soon after surgery. There are good signs and worrisome signs.

I have to stay positive, even when I’m shaking, sweating and crying from the pain. I want my mobility and my life back!

Please send all the love and prayers and positive vibes you can. I’m going to try to fall asleep somehow. I have to keep pushing forward.

I’m just trying to be brave while in tremendous pain, and honestly, I’m really scared.

Time to take my medicine and try to get some sleep. I will pray again and imagine myself surrounded by a cradle of light. I always repent when praying, and today is one of the times I need to be thankful for the blessings I am too blind to see at the moment.

I have to make it. I have to be able to live again. Life is waiting for me, and I want to be the new man I’ve become while dealing with pain. I found out who I really am. I accept it. I will be grateful for all that God gives to me, while He continues to help me get through one day at a time.

Goodnight. 🙏🏼❤️

Tuttavia la superpia di alcuni allievi porta quasi a rinnegare ciò che gli era stato insegnato o trasmesso.

Ritengono ormai essere superiori con le loro nuove conoscenze o abbagliati dai loro grandi risultati ottenuti. 

Spesso sono folgorati da nuovi maestri e denigrano i vecchi.

La gratitudine è un sentimento di riconoscenza verso chi ci ha dato e fatto del bene. 

Ci ha donanto il suo tempo, il suo sapere, le sue attenzioni e in alcuni casi anche il suo affetto. 

Il tuo essere attuale è anche il frutto di quello che i tuoi primi maestri ti hanno donato.

सारख्याच प्रमाणात आढळून येणारी मोठी व्याधी म्हणजे उह, आह, आउच करायला लावणारी कंबरदुखी.

कंबरदुखी माहिती नाही अशी व्यक्ती बहुधा
सापडणे कठीण जाईल. कायमस्वरुपी नाही तर कधी ना कधी थोड्या वेळासाठी कंबर दुखीचा अनुभव हा येतोच. कंबर हा शरीराचा सर्वाधिक प्रमाणात हलचाल केला जाणारा भाग आहे.
उठबस करणे, चालणे, वाकणे, वाकून वजन उचलणे इत्यादी सर्व क्रिया करताना कंबरेतून हालचाल होतेच, एवढच नाही तर बसलेल्या जागी किंवा एका ठिकाणी उभे राहिल्यास कमरेवरती थोडासा का होईना भार येतोच.

आयुर्वेदीक दृष्ट्या कंबर अर्थात 'कटी” हे
वातदोषाचे राहण्याचे ठिकाण सांगितले आहे. वात दोष जर वाढला तर कंबरदुखी सारख्या आजार निर्माण करतो.

स्वास्थस्य स्वास्थ्य रक्षणमं ।
आतुरस्य विकार प्रशमनच ।

स्वस्थ व्यक्तीचा विचार करत असताना ज्या
व्यक्तीचे दोष (वात-पित्त-कफ) अग्नि (जाठराग्नि / धात्वाग्नि) सप्तधातू व मल यांची क्रिया जर समप्रमाणात असेल त्याचबरोबर आत्मा, इंद्रिय आणि मन स्वस्थ असतील तरच त्याला संपूर्ण स्वस्थ व्यक्ती म्हणू शकतो. ज्या वेळी याचा समतोल नाश पावतो त्यावेळी आजार उत्पन्न होतात.

आज काल या युगात पैशाशिवाय काहीही चालत
नाही, त्यामुळे जास्त श्रम करून कमी वेळेत जास्त पैसा
मिळविण्याचा कल वाढत चालला आहे व त्यामुळे कळत नकळतच आरोग्याच्या तक्रारी सुद्धा वाढत चालल्या आहेत. अशा धकाधकीच्या जीवनामध्ये प्रत्येक माणसाच्या जीवनात एकदा ना एकदा कंबरदुखीचा त्रास हा उद्भवतो. अशी एक सुद्धा व्यक्ती नाही ज्याच्या जीवनामध्ये कंबरदुखीचा त्रास झालेला नाही. परंतु या आजारावर परिपूर्ण असा उपचार अजूनपर्यंत निघालेला नाही, असे म्हटले तरी चालेल.
कारण दुखणे कमी करणे
हा आजाराचा मुळ उपचार नाही
दुखणे कसे झाले? त्यामुळे शरीरातील आतल्या
अवयवामध्ये काय घडामोडी अथवा विकृती झालेल्या
आहेत, याचा विचार न करता फक्त दुखणं कमी होण्यासाठी
“पेन किलर"" औषधे घेणे म्हणजे हा पूर्ण उपचार नव्हे. विकृतीचा नाश करणे म्हणजेच संपूर्ण उपचार ।
सम्प्राप्ती विघटनेमेव चिकित्सा निगध्‌ते ।  अशा पेन किलरच्या उपचारामुळे दुखणे थांबते
परंतु आजार बरा होत नाही. आणि जो पर्यंत आजार बरा
होत नाही तो पर्यंत तुमच्या तक्रारी थांबत नाहीत.

Helping people to move better 🧎🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️",2020-08-10 04:52:39,"Our thoracic spine or “T-SPINE” covers our mid-back area and is usually overlooked that’s why limited range of motion in this region is common. It may also be affected by various factors such as prolonged slouched posture.

Improving mobility in this area can lead to better shoulder mobility (which is vital to certain tasks like overhead reaching, or even performance such as lifting weights). It l may also have a positive influence on prevention of low back pain.

Here are some moves to mobilize your T-SPINE:

1️⃣ Seated Cat-Camel
2️⃣ T Spine Open Book
3️⃣ T Spine Wipe Around
4️⃣ T Spine Extension

Has Covid got anyone else feeling they are about 30 sessions away from where they want to be?!?! 
I for one have definitely let many new habits sneak in over the last few months...... far too much sourdough 🍞 and far too little exercise 👟 to name two of the biggest offenders 🙈
I am rustling up my motivation to re set a few of these things and will be embarking on completing the magic 30 classes that Joseph Pilates speaks of. I will keep you updated along the way and if anyone would like to join me I'd love your company!

With many more people working from home (at dining tables or sitting on the couch) we are seeing an increase in the number of people complaining of sore lower backs as well as tight neck and shoulders. 

Three things that you can do at home to help include: 
⭐️ try to set up a proper ergonomic setup with screens and a proper chair, as opposed to working from a laptop
⭐️ take regular breaks to stand and walk around (ideally every hour if possible and maybe even a long walk during lunch)
⭐️ stretch daily (Youtube is a great resource for stretching or you can get on demand yoga from @sydneyyogacollective) 

If you’re still feeling an ache or pain or two, and you need a little bit more help, then why not come in to see us in clinic for a good back massage. Click on our bio to book online.

I help you get back to doing the things you want to do- pain free!",2020-08-10 04:09:50,"Hey all! Posting this again as I know many kids have begun online school, so here are some tips to set up your work/study space.  If you have a good set up from the start, you can reduce the chances of ending up with neck and back pain.

Tip 1: Have some support behind your back - whether that’s a rolled up towel or a small pillow, this will help your posture!

Tip 2: Try to keep your screen at eye level ...in this video we could have added a couple more books to get the computer to eye level - as this reduces the strain on the neck muscles.

Tip 3: (Which I forgot to mention:) Take a break every half hour - stand up and walk around, or simply change up your position.

Hope these help, and if you have specific questions feel free to DM me!  Wishing you all the best as you kiddos start a new school year!!! You got this!
