# Are Healthcare Professionals Watching Their Mouths?: An Analysis of Common Verbiage Used In Low Back Pain Instagram Posts

### Purpose
I am a Doctor of Physical Therapy interested in blending the worlds of Healthcare and Data Science. As a practicing orthopedic Physical Therapist, we frequently utilize Instagram as a platform for educating the public and marketing to prospective patients/clients. Therefore, there are millions of posts dedicated to spreading information related to common musculoskeletal injuries and conditions. 

Especially as of late, there has been a focus on the impact of the words used during medical interactions on clinical outcomes. We understand that psychological factors can have a significantly greater influence on predicting pain and disability levels, yet healthcare professionals continue to stricly focus on the biomedical components. Potentially threatening and vague language is commonplace during patient-provider interactions. An in depth discussion on this topic can be found in the paper entitled *"Sticks and Stones: The Impact of Language in Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation"*, which is a part of this repository.

One of the most common, and polarizing, musculoskeletal injuries that healthcare professionals are faced with is low back pain. In fact, there are approximately 1.2 million Instagram posts with the hashtag *"#backpain"*.

The interplay between the use of the Instagram platform, the importance of the words used in treating musculoskeletal conditions, and the sheer amount of data available for back pain posts resulted in a curiosity as to how well guidelines on language were being followed on the Instagram platform.
